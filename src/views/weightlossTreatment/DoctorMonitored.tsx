      a: "A medical weight loss clinic operates under medical licensing with licensed doctors who can prescribe, adjust, and supervise treatment, conduct blood tests, and manage health conditions that complicate weight loss. Commercial slimming centres cannot provide the same clinical supervision.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need to follow a strict diet and exercise plan during the programme?",
      a: "Diet and exercise still matter, but the programme is designed to be realistic rather than rigid. Nutrition and activity guidance are adapted to Malaysian food culture, lifestyle, and any mobility limitations.",
    },
    {
      q: "Am I a candidate for GLP-1 weight loss medications like Ozempic or Mounjaro?",
      a: "GLP-1 medications are generally considered for adults with BMI 27 or above plus at least one weight-related medical condition, or BMI 30 or above without comorbidities. Full medical consultation and blood tests are required before prescription.",
    },
    {
      q: "How much weight can I expect to lose on a medically supervised programme?",
      a: "Results vary by starting weight, protocol, adherence and metabolic profile. As a broad guide, Duromine or HCG programmes may produce a few kilograms per month, while GLP-1 programmes and tirzepatide-based programmes can produce much larger percentage reductions over longer timelines.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is bariatric surgery something Nexus Clinic KL offers or can refer for?",
      a: "Nexus Clinic KL does not perform bariatric surgery directly but can provide medically guided preparation, maintenance support, and referral to accredited bariatric specialists in Kuala Lumpur when surgery is the appropriate option.",
    },
    {
      q: "What blood tests are done as part of the weight loss programme?",
      a: "The initial blood panel may include full blood count, kidney and liver function, fasting glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile, thyroid markers, and selected hormonal markers when clinically indicated.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I lose weight if I have a hormonal condition like hypothyroidism or PCOS?",
      a: "Yes, but the programme must account for the hormonal driver. Nexus Clinic KL screens for issues like thyroid dysfunction, insulin resistance and PCOS-related metabolic problems before finalising the treatment plan.",
    },
    {
      q: "How long do I need to stay on weight loss medications?",
      a: "The answer depends on the medication and your clinical response. GLP-1 programmes are often longer-term because obesity is a chronic condition and stopping treatment too early can lead to regain without a proper maintenance strategy.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is the weight loss programme safe for patients with hypertension or diabetes?",
      a: "Yes, and in many cases it is especially appropriate because even modest weight loss can improve blood pressure, glucose control and cardiovascular risk. These patients are monitored more closely during active treatment.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I get started with a weight loss programme at Nexus Clinic KL?",
      a: "The process starts with a complimentary first consultation at Nexus Clinic KL, followed by medical assessment, blood tests when needed, and a personalised plan before treatment begins.",

                Addressing the root causes of weight gain
              </h2>

              <p className="font-inter text-brown/80">
                Modern obesity medicine recognises that weight gain is not a
                personal failure. It is driven by hormonal, metabolic,
                neurological, structural and behavioural factors that often
                require medical intervention to correct.
              </p>

              <p className="font-inter text-brown/80">
                This is why diet and exercise alone often fail without medical
                support. Repeated caloric restriction can slow metabolism,
                increase hunger and encourage rebound weight gain. Doctor-led
                weight loss works by treating the physiology behind the pattern.
              </p>
              <p className="font-inter text-brown/80">
                Supervision by an experienced healthcare professional is not optional when these risk factors are present. It is essential. Self-managed weight loss in patients with hypertension, fatty liver, or metabolic syndrome carries real clinical risk if medications are adjusted or caloric restriction is too severe without monitoring. The structured blood tests, vital sign checks, and ongoing doctor oversight built into every programme at Nexus Clinic KL ensure safety at every stage. Patients who are interested in body contouring as an adjunct to weight reduction may also benefit from{' '}
