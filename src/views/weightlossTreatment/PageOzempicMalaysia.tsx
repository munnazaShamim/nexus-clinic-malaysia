    {
      q: "Is Ozempic legal in Malaysia for weight loss?",
      a: "Ozempic is NPRA-registered in Malaysia for type 2 diabetes treatment. When prescribed for weight management in non-diabetic patients, it is used off-label. Off-label prescribing is legal in Malaysia and remains the prescribing doctor's clinical responsibility.",
    },
    {
      q: "How much weight can I lose with Ozempic in Malaysia?",
      a: "Clinical trials using semaglutide have consistently shown average body weight reductions of 10 to 15% over 12 to 18 months when combined with lifestyle support. Individual results vary based on starting weight, dose achieved, adherence, and metabolic health.",
    },
    {
      q: "How quickly does Ozempic start working?",
      a: "Most patients notice reduced appetite and fewer food cravings within the first one to two weeks at the 0.25 mg starting dose. Visible weight loss commonly becomes more noticeable by weeks four to six, especially after titration to 0.5 mg.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is the Ozempic price in Malaysia per month?",
      a: "As of 2026, one Ozempic pen in Malaysia commonly costs between RM 900 and RM 1,400 depending on the dose and clinic. At Nexus Clinic KL, the total monthly programme cost including reviews and support usually ranges from around RM 1,100 to RM 1,600, with package pricing available.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I use Ozempic if I do not have diabetes?",
      a: "Yes. Licensed doctors in Malaysia can prescribe Ozempic off-label for weight management in patients without type 2 diabetes who meet clinical criteria, such as BMI above 27.5 with weight-related comorbidities or BMI above 30.",
    },
    {
      q: "Will I regain weight after stopping Ozempic?",
      a: "Weight regain is common if semaglutide is stopped without a structured exit plan. This is why the Nexus Clinic KL programme includes tapering, nutritional coaching, behavioural reinforcement, and a maintenance protocol.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is the difference between Ozempic and Mounjaro for weight loss?",
      a: "Ozempic contains semaglutide and activates the GLP-1 receptor. Mounjaro contains tirzepatide and activates both GLP-1 and GIP receptors, which usually produces greater appetite suppression and higher average weight loss, but at a higher cost.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is Ozempic safe long-term?",
      a: "Semaglutide has extensive real-world safety data globally. Long-term use can be appropriate for selected patients under medical supervision, but pancreatic, gallbladder, thyroid and metabolic monitoring may be required during treatment.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can Ozempic be combined with other weight loss treatments?",
      a: "Yes. At Nexus Clinic KL, Ozempic may be combined with structured lifestyle support and later followed by non-invasive body contouring such as fat freezing or CoolSculpting if stubborn localised fat remains after overall weight reduction.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I get Ozempic in Malaysia legally and safely?",
      a: "Ozempic must be obtained by prescription from a licensed medical practitioner in Malaysia. Patients should only buy from registered clinics or authorised pharmacies with proper cold-chain storage and should avoid unregulated online sellers.",

              <p className="text-lg text-taupe font-inter leading-relaxed">
                Ozempic is the brand name for semaglutide, a synthetic analogue
                of the GLP-1 hormone naturally produced by the gut after eating.
                It works through the brain, pancreas and gut to reduce appetite,
                slow gastric emptying and support better glucose control.

                  Patients often eat less not because of stronger willpower, but
                  because hunger signals and food cravings are chemically
                  moderated at a biological level.

                Choosing the right GLP-1 pathway
              </h3>
                <p className="text-brown">
                  Ozempic is the most accessible and cost-effective entry point for GLP-1 therapy in Malaysia with the strongest NPRA registration history. Wegovy uses the same active ingredient as Ozempic (semaglutide) but at a higher maximum dose of 2.4 mg weekly, which was specifically approved for weight management rather than diabetes. Mounjaro (tirzepatide) adds a second receptor pathway (GIP) to GLP-1 activation, producing the highest average weight loss currently available in any injectable medication. Saxenda requires daily injection, which reduces convenience compared to the weekly options.

Where further body contouring is appropriate after significant weight loss, our doctors can also advise on combination approaches with non-invasive options to improve insulin sensitivity.
