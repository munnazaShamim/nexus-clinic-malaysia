  const faqData = [
    { q: "Is beard transplant permanent in Malaysia?", a: "Yes. The transplanted hair follicles come from the DHT-resistant donor area at the back of the scalp and are genetically programmed to continue growing for the patient's lifetime. Once the transplanted follicles are established in the beard area, the hair continues to grow naturally and is not subject to the hormonal miniaturisation that causes pattern hair loss. The transplanted hair can be shaved, shaped, and groomed exactly like natural beard hair, and it will regrow at the normal rate after shaving." },
    { q: "How many grafts does a full beard transplant require?", a: "A full beard covering the cheeks, chin, jawline, and moustache area typically requires 1,500 to 3,000 grafts depending on the existing facial hair density and the desired final density of the transplanted beard. Patients with sparse but existing facial hair require fewer grafts because the transplant supplements rather than creates from scratch. Patients with no facial hair across the full beard area need more grafts to create the complete coverage. The doctor will calculate the number of grafts needed at the beard design consultation after assessing the coverage area and density goals." },
    { q: "Can a beard transplant fill in only patchy areas?", a: "Yes, and this is one of the most common beard goals among patients at Nexus Clinic KL. Men with some existing facial hair but uneven or patchy areas can receive a targeted beard transplant that fills in the sparse zones to match the density of the surrounding natural facial hair. This approach requires fewer grafts than a full beard transplant and produces a result that blends seamlessly with the existing facial hair. The design consultation maps the specific patchy areas and plans implantation density to match the surrounding beard texture and direction." },
    { q: "Does beard transplant leave any scars?", a: "Using the FUE technique, the donor area at the back of the scalp develops only tiny circular dot scars at each extraction site. These are not visible under normal hair length and require very close shaving to become noticeable. There are no stitches, no linear scar, and no visible evidence of the donor harvest under everyday hair length. At the beard recipient area, tiny scabs form at each implant site and fall away naturally within seven to ten days, leaving no visible trace of the procedure once healing is complete." },
    { q: "When will my transplanted beard start to grow?", a: "After the initial shock loss of transplanted hair shafts at two to four weeks, the hair follicles enter a dormant phase before new growth begins. New beard hair begins to grow from the transplanted follicles from month three to four, initially appearing as fine, short hairs that gradually thicken. By month six, meaningful coverage is visible. The full result with natural density and length potential is established at month nine to twelve. This timeline mirrors the scalp hair transplant growth timeline and is the same regardless of whether FUE or DHI technique is used." },
    { q: "Can a beard transplant be combined with an eyebrow transplant in the same session?", a: "Yes, and combining beard and eyebrow transplant in a single session is possible when the total graft count is manageable within one session's duration. Both procedures use the same scalp donor area and the same FUE extraction technique. Combined sessions are cost-efficient and reduce total recovery time. However, the implantation of eyebrow grafts requires the most precise angle control of any facial hair transplant zone, so the surgeon must be experienced in eyebrow-specific technique. At Nexus Clinic KL, the clinical team advises on the feasibility of a combined session at the consultation based on the total grafts needed for both areas." },
    { q: "What is the difference between FUE and DHI for beard transplant in Malaysia?", a: "FUE extracts individual hair follicles and implants them into pre-made recipient sites, giving the surgeon good control over direction. DHI uses a patented implanter pen that simultaneously extracts and implants each follicle in a single step, providing superior control over the angle and direction of each hair at the moment of implantation. For beard transplant, the DHI technique is particularly valuable in precision zones like the moustache and sideburn borders where natural growth direction is critical to a natural-looking outcome. FUE is appropriate for larger coverage areas where efficiency and graft count are the primary priorities." },
    { q: "Are beard transplant results natural-looking?", a: "Yes, when the procedure is performed by an experienced transplant surgeon who controls the angle and direction of implantation to match the natural growth pattern of the beard zone being treated. The transplanted hair is the patient's own scalp hair relocated to the face, so the texture and growth characteristics are essentially equivalent to any natural hair follicle. The key variable determining whether the result looks natural is the precision of implantation angle, which is why choosing a surgeon with specific beard transplant experience matters significantly more than the technique used." },
    { q: "How long does the beard transplant procedure take and what is the recovery?", a: "A moustache or goatee transplant requiring 300 to 800 grafts takes approximately three to five hours including design, anaesthesia, extraction, and implantation. A full beard transplant requiring 1,500 to 3,000 grafts takes six to eight hours. Both are performed as day sessions under local anaesthesia with no hospital admission required. Recovery involves mild facial swelling and redness for two to three days, scabbing at the implant sites for seven to ten days, and a return to work within three to five days for most patients. Strenuous exercise and direct sun exposure to the face should be avoided for the first two weeks." },
    { q: "Is Nexus Clinic KL one of the beard transplant clinics in Malaysia I should consider?", a: "Nexus Clinic KL is a licensed hair transplant clinic in Malaysia offering beard transplant procedures performed by qualified surgeons under full Ministry of Health Malaysia-compliant clinical standards. Over 5,000 facial filler and hair restoration procedures have been completed at the clinic, with a team that combines medical expertise with the aesthetic sensibility required to produce natural-looking beard results for patients across KL, Petaling Jaya, Bangsar, and throughout Malaysia. The clinic offers a complimentary first consultation, full beard design session before any surgery, transparent graft-count and pricing breakdown, and structured aftercare." },
