  // Causes of Hair Loss Table Data
  const causesTable = [
    {
      cause: "DHT and Hormonal Changes",
      mechanism: "DHT binds to androgen receptors in genetically susceptible follicles, progressively miniaturising them. Hormonal changes at menopause, post-partum, or from thyroid/PCOS conditions cause hair loss through different mechanisms.",
      affected: "Majority of Malaysian men with progressive thinning. Perimenopausal and post-partum women. Women with PCOS. Those with undiagnosed thyroid conditions.",
      approach: "Hormonal assessment included in every initial evaluation. Thyroid function, testosterone, DHEA-S, oestrogen checked where indicated. Treat underlying hormonal imbalance first."
    },
    {
      cause: "Nutritional Deficiency",
      mechanism: "Iron required for metabolic activity of hair follicle matrix cells. Iron deficiency impairs healthy growth. Vitamin D, zinc, biotin and protein deficiency contribute to thinning hair.",
      affected: "Malaysian women with heavy periods. Vegetarians and vegans. Those with chronic restrictive dieting. Patients exposed to harsh chemical treatments and environmental stressors.",
      approach: "Blood test for nutritional status (iron, ferritin, vitamin D, zinc, full blood count). Correcting deficiencies is most effective treatment. Dietary improvement and lifestyle changes provided."
    },
    {
      cause: "Autoimmune (Alopecia Areata)",
      mechanism: "Immune system mistakenly targets hair follicles. Follicles enter state of arrested activity, not permanently destroyed. Bald patches appear suddenly.",
      affected: "Any age, both males and females. Often begins in childhood or young adulthood. Associated with thyroid disease, vitiligo, Type 1 diabetes. Family history is risk factor.",
      approach: "Diagnosis confirmed by clinical examination or scalp biopsy. Managed with intralesional corticosteroids, topical immunotherapy, PRP as regenerative option."
    },
    {
      cause: "Stress, Lifestyle and Scalp Health",
      mechanism: "Chronic psychological stress causes telogen effluvium. Large proportion of follicles simultaneously enter resting phase. Diffuse hair fall 2-3 months after stress event.",
      affected: "Malaysian professionals with work-related stress. Post-COVID hair loss patients. New mothers with post-partum hair fall. Those with chronic scalp conditions.",
      approach: "Lifestyle changes and stress management discussed at every consultation. Scalp health assessment included. Shampoo and tonic recommendations provided in writing."

  // FAQ Data (expanded from content)
  const faqData = [
    { q: "Can hair loss be reversed naturally?", a: "Sometimes. If hair loss is linked to a temporary trigger like stress or mild nutrient issues, it may improve when the trigger is addressed. Genetic pattern loss (androgenetic alopecia) usually needs medical treatment for real change. At Nexus Clinic KL, we identify the specific cause before recommending any treatment approach." },
    { q: "What is the most effective hair loss treatment in Malaysia?", a: "The most effective treatment depends entirely on your type of hair loss. For androgenetic alopecia (pattern hair loss), the combination of finasteride (for men), topical minoxidil, and PRP produces the best results. For telogen effluvium, identifying and removing the trigger is most effective. For alopecia areata, intralesional corticosteroid injections and PRP show good results. A proper diagnosis at Nexus Clinic KL ensures you receive the treatment matched to your specific condition." },
    { q: "How long does it take to see results from hair loss treatment?", a: "Most treatments need at least 3 to 6 months of consistency before visible change appears. Minoxidil typically shows results at 3-6 months. Finasteride shows hair loss slowing at 3-6 months and maximum benefit at 12-24 months. PRP shows improvement beginning from the second session onward, with maximum results at 3-6 months after completing the initial 3-session course. Patience and consistency are essential for optimal outcomes." },
    { q: "Is PRP treatment effective for hair regrowth in Malaysia?", a: "Yes. PRP (platelet-rich plasma) is an effective treatment for stimulating hair growth in patients with androgenetic alopecia and in some patients with alopecia areata. PRP delivers growth factors including PDGF, VEGF and TGF-beta directly to hair follicles. Published clinical studies consistently show improvement in hair density and scalp hair count after a course of PRP treatment. PRP is most effective when combined with finasteride and minoxidil rather than used as a standalone treatment." },
    { q: "How many PRP sessions do I need for hair loss?", a: "Most patients require 3 to 4 initial PRP sessions spaced 4 to 6 weeks apart. After completing the initial course, maintenance sessions every 4 to 6 months help preserve the results. The exact number depends on your specific hair loss type, the extent of thinning, and how well your follicles respond to treatment. Your personalised treatment plan at Nexus Clinic KL will include a clear session schedule based on your assessment." },
    { q: "What are the side effects of PRP for hair?", a: "Most reported side effects are temporary and mild, including tenderness at injection sites, mild scalp redness, and slight swelling that resolves within 24 to 48 hours. Because PRP uses your own blood components, there is no risk of allergic reaction. Some patients experience mild headache on the day of treatment. Serious complications are extremely rare when performed by a qualified medical professional." },
    { q: "Is finasteride safe for hair loss treatment?", a: "Finasteride is used for male pattern hair loss but requires proper medical counselling. Side effects can include sexual side effects (reported in 1-2% of users) and rare mood changes. Regulators have issued reminders about psychiatric risks. Finasteride should only be taken under medical supervision with regular follow-up. At Nexus Clinic KL, we discuss all risks thoroughly before prescribing and monitor patients throughout treatment. Women who are or may be pregnant must never use finasteride." },
    { q: "Does minoxidil regrow hair permanently?", a: "Minoxidil can help early hair loss and may slow loss or support regrowth, but it will not restore an entire head of hair. It requires consistent use for months to see results. If minoxidil works for you, you typically need to continue using it to maintain benefits. Stopping minoxidil usually leads to gradual return of hair loss within 3 to 6 months. Minoxidil is most effective when started early, before significant follicle miniaturisation has occurred." },
    { q: "What causes hair loss in Malaysian women?", a: "Common causes of hair loss in Malaysian women include: female pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia), telogen effluvium from stress or post-partum changes, iron deficiency (particularly common in women with heavy periods), thyroid dysfunction, PCOS-related hormonal changes, traction alopecia from tight hairstyles, and nutritional deficiencies. A proper diagnosis at Nexus Clinic KL avoids wasted time on inappropriate treatments." },
    { q: "Can stress cause hair loss?", a: "Yes. Stress is a well-recognised trigger for telogen effluvium, a condition where a large number of hair follicles simultaneously enter the resting phase, causing diffuse hair fall 2 to 3 months after the stressful event. Chronic psychological stress, significant illness, surgery, or dramatic weight loss can all trigger this response. In most cases, hair grows back naturally when the stress trigger is resolved, though nutritional support and minoxidil can accelerate recovery." },
    { q: "When should I consider a hair transplant?", a: "A hair transplant should be considered when hair follicles in an area are no longer producing hair and non-surgical treatments cannot revive them. For most patients, we recommend starting with a 12-month non-surgical programme (finasteride, minoxidil, PRP) before considering transplant. This stabilises ongoing hair loss and maximises existing density. Men with advanced baldness (Norwood grade V to VII) are more likely to be transplant candidates. At Nexus Clinic KL, we provide honest guidance on whether you are an immediate or deferred transplant candidate." },
    { q: "How much does hair loss treatment cost in Malaysia?", a: "Costs vary by treatment type and number of sessions. PRP sessions typically range from RM 800 to RM 2,500 per session. Hair transplant costs range from RM 6,000 to RM 15,000 depending on graft count and technique. Medication plans vary based on product and dose. A comprehensive non-surgical programme including PRP, finasteride, minoxidil and follow-up consultations costs approximately RM 7,000 to RM 15,000 annually. At Nexus Clinic KL, all pricing is disclosed at the initial consultation before any treatment begins." },
    { q: "What scalp care does Nexus Clinic KL recommend between treatments?", a: "Between hair loss treatment sessions, patients receive a personalised self-care programme including: appropriate shampoo selection for their specific scalp type (oily, dry, seborrhoeic, normal); scalp tonic applied directly to the scalp after cleansing; sun exposure protection using a cap or hat in Malaysia's intense UV environment; dietary guidance including adequate protein and iron-rich foods; lifestyle changes including stress management; and specific post-treatment scalp care instructions after every PRP or mesotherapy session. The post-treatment self-care programme is as important as the clinical treatment itself." },
    { q: "Is the hair loss consultation at Nexus Clinic KL free?", a: "The initial hair loss assessment at Nexus Clinic KL is priced at RM 150 to RM 300 and includes a comprehensive trichoscopy scalp examination, hair loss type diagnosis, blood test panel where indicated for medical causes of hair loss, personalised treatment recommendation with full pricing, and discussion of all treatment options including finasteride, minoxidil, PRP, laser therapy, and when considering a hair transplant is appropriate. This investment ensures you receive a proper diagnosis rather than a generic sales pitch." },

              <h3 className="font-georgia text-xl text-brown mb-3">Scalp Cleansing and Shampoo Selection</h3>
              <p className="text-taupe font-inter text-sm mb-3">Regular scalp cleansing with an appropriate shampoo removes sebum, dead skin cells, product buildup and pollutants that can clog hair follicles. In Malaysia's humid climate, daily or every-other-day cleansing is typically appropriate.</p>
              <p className="text-wine font-inter text-sm font-semibold">At Nexus Clinic KL:</p>
              <p className="text-taupe font-inter text-sm">Patients receive specific shampoo selection advice based on their scalp condition (oily, dry, seborrhoeic dermatitis, normal) rather than generic guidance.</p>

              <p className="text-taupe font-inter text-sm mb-3">A scalp tonic applied directly to the scalp between treatment sessions delivers active ingredients to the follicle level without dilution from shampoo rinse.</p>

              <p className="text-taupe font-inter text-sm mb-3">Malaysia's year-round UV index of 10-13 damages hair follicle DNA and degrades the scalp skin barrier. Men with thinning hair are particularly vulnerable.</p>
              <p className="text-wine font-inter text-sm font-semibold">At Nexus Clinic KL:</p>
              <p className="text-taupe font-inter text-sm">Sun exposure protection is included in the self-care guidance at every consultation. Patients are specifically advised to protect the scalp in the 48 hours after treatment.</p>

              <p className="text-taupe font-inter text-sm mb-3">Adequate dietary protein, iron, vitamin D, zinc, biotin and omega-3 fatty acids are essential for healthy hair growth. In Malaysian patients, iron deficiency is the most common nutritional cause.</p>

              <p className="text-taupe font-inter text-sm">Nutritional assessment is included in the initial evaluation. Dietary advice and supplement recommendations are provided based on blood test results.</p>
