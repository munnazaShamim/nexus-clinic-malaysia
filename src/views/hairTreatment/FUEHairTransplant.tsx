  const faqData = [
    { q: "What makes FUE different from FUT hair transplant?", a: "FUE extracts individual hair follicles one by one using a circular punch, leaving only tiny circular dot scars that are invisible at normal hair length. FUT removes a strip of skin from the donor area, which is then dissected into grafts. FUT leaves a linear scar that is visible if the hair is cut very short. FUE offers faster recovery, no linear scar, and more versatile donor site options. FUT can harvest more grafts per session for patients with advanced baldness and costs less per graft. The best approach depends on the patient's specific hair loss stage, donor density, and cosmetic preferences." },
    { q: "Is FUE hair transplant in Malaysia permanent?", a: "Yes. The transplanted hair follicles come from the DHT-resistant zone at the back and sides of the scalp. Because these follicles are genetically immune to the hormone that causes pattern hair loss, they continue growing permanently after transplantation to the recipient site. The transplanted hair grows, cycles, sheds, and regrows just like natural hair for the patient's lifetime. However, the patient's existing non-transplanted hair may continue to thin over time without additional medication, which is why many hair transplant surgeons recommend concurrent use of finasteride or minoxidil to preserve the surrounding hair." },
    { q: "How many grafts will I need for my FUE hair transplant?", a: "Graft count depends on the extent of your hair loss, the density of your donor area, and the density you want to achieve at the recipient site. As a general guide: hairline restoration requires 1,000 to 2,000 grafts, crown area treatment needs 1,500 to 3,000 grafts, and moderate to advanced pattern hair loss may require 3,000 to 4,000 grafts. The definitive number is determined at a scalp assessment by the surgeon at Nexus Clinic KL, who maps the donor area under magnification and calculates the safe extractable number of grafts specific to your anatomy." },
    { q: "How do I choose the best hair transplant clinic in Malaysia for FUE?", a: "The right hair transplant clinic is one where the surgeon performs every step of the procedure directly, from design through extraction and implantation, rather than delegating surgical steps to nurses or technicians. Confirm the surgeon is registered with the Malaysian Medical Council and ideally holds training credentials from international bodies such as the ISHRS. Ask to see before-and-after photographs of real patients treated at the clinic with similar hair types and loss stages. A reputable clinic provides a transparent graft count and cost breakdown, offers realistic outcome expectations rather than guaranteed results, and includes structured aftercare in the programme." },
    { q: "What is the recovery like after FUE hair transplant in Malaysia?", a: "Recovery from FUE is typically five to ten days for the visible healing stages. Most patients return to desk work within three to five days. The donor area shows tiny pink dots that fade within a week. Scabbing at the recipient site resolves within ten to fourteen days. Patients avoid strenuous physical activity for two to three weeks. The shock loss phase where transplanted hair falls out occurs at two to four weeks and resolves as new hair growth begins from month three. Full results are visible at month twelve to fifteen and are reviewed by the surgeon at scheduled follow-up appointments." },
    { q: "Is FUE hair transplant suitable for women?", a: "Yes. FUE hair transplant is performed for women with localised hair loss patterns including traction alopecia, hairline recession, thinning around the part, and post-surgical scar coverage. Women with diffuse hair loss across the entire scalp require individual assessment because diffuse patterns may not have a stable donor area free from miniaturisation. The no-shave FUE option, where only small sections of the donor area are trimmed rather than the entire head, is available and is particularly suitable for female patients who prefer not to shave during their procedure." },
    { q: "Can I combine FUE with other hair loss treatments?", a: "Yes, and combination approaches produce the best long-term outcomes. FUE transplants the hair follicles that are already lost, while medical treatments like finasteride and minoxidil protect the existing hair that has not yet been lost. PRP and exosome therapy support graft integration, scalp health, and the vitality of surrounding follicles. A comprehensive hair treatment plan addressing both surgical restoration and medical preservation delivers fuller, more sustained results than FUE alone." },
    { q: "How much does FUE hair transplant cost in Malaysia?", a: "FUE hair transplant cost in Malaysia is calculated per graft, with most clinics charging between RM 8 and RM 12 per graft depending on surgeon credentials, clinic infrastructure, and the technique used. A hairline restoration session of 1,200 to 1,500 grafts typically costs between RM 10,000 and RM 18,000 at a reputable clinic in Kuala Lumpur. A moderate-loss session of 2,500 grafts costs approximately RM 20,000 to RM 30,000. Malaysia offers significant cost advantages over equivalent procedures in Australia, the UK, or Singapore without compromising clinical standards." },
    { q: "What is advanced FUE and how does DHI relate to it?", a: "Advanced FUE refers to techniques that go beyond standard motorised extraction to improve graft survival, precision, or patient experience. DHI (Direct Hair Implantation) is the most clinically significant advancement: it uses a specialised Choi implanter pen to combine extraction and implantation in a single continuous step, minimising the time each graft spends outside the body and eliminating the need for pre-made incisions at the recipient site. This improves graft survival rates to 95 to 99 percent and allows more precise control over angle, depth, and direction of each individual hair. DHI is particularly valuable for hairline design and dense packing applications." },
    { q: "How do I know if I am ready for FUE hair transplant?", a: "The ideal candidate for FUE hair transplant has stabilised hair loss, a sufficient donor area density, and realistic expectations about coverage goals. Hair loss should be stable for at least twelve months before surgery so the transplanted grafts are not placed into an area that will continue receding. Patients should be in good general health, not taking medications that increase bleeding risk, and prepared for the shock loss phase that occurs in the weeks after surgery. A thorough pre-operative assessment confirms all of these factors and ensures that the procedure is appropriate before any session is planned." },
