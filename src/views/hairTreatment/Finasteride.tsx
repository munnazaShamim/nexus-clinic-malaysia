    { step: "DHT Production from Testosterone", biology: "In men with androgenetic alopecia, testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the scalp by the 5-alpha reductase enzyme, primarily Type II. DHT is a more potent androgen than testosterone.", relevance: "Understanding that DHT drives hair follicle miniaturisation rather than testosterone itself is clinically important. Reducing DHT levels in the scalp is the most targeted intervention for stopping hair loss.", implication: "At Nexus Clinic KL, all men presenting with hair loss concerns receive a full hair and scalp assessment before finasteride is prescribed." },
    { step: "Follicle Miniaturisation from DHT", biology: "DHT binds to androgen receptors in the hair follicle and causes progressive shortening of the anagen (growth) phase. Over time the follicle produces only vellus hairs before becoming inactive.", relevance: "Finasteride is most effective when started at early signs of hair loss because viable follicles that have only partially miniaturised can recover once DHT levels are reduced.", implication: "Men presenting with early signs of hair loss are counselled on the progressive nature of androgenetic alopecia and the importance of starting effective treatment before significant follicle miniaturisation." },
    { step: "Finasteride Blocks 5-Alpha Reductase", biology: "Finasteride blocks the 5-alpha reductase enzyme at the active site, preventing conversion of testosterone to DHT. Finasteride 1mg reduces DHT levels in the scalp by approximately 60 to 70%.", relevance: "Clinical trials show that approximately 83 to 90% of men taking finasteride maintain or improve their hair count at 2 years. Finasteride helps prevent further hair loss in the majority of men.", implication: "Finasteride 1mg is the standard starting prescription for men with androgenetic alopecia who meet clinical criteria. Response is assessed at 6 and 12 months using standardised hair density photography." },
    { step: "Hair Regrowth Mechanism", biology: "Finasteride does not directly stimulate hair growth. It prevents DHT-driven miniaturisation. When DHT levels are reduced, partially miniaturised follicles can begin to recover, producing progressively thicker, longer hairs.", relevance: "Setting realistic expectations about hair regrowth is critical. Finasteride primarily slows or stops further hair loss rather than producing dramatic hair regrowth.", implication: "The hair loss treatment programme is explained with specific timelines: stopping hair loss progression (6 to 12 months) versus hair regrowth (12 to 24 months) are presented as distinct expected outcomes." },

Men who experience sexual dysfunction are instructed to report this immediately and the medication is reviewed." },
    { category: "Post-Finasteride Syndrome and Suicidal Ideation", evidence: "Post-Finasteride Syndrome describes persistent sexual, neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms after discontinuing finasteride. The FDA updated finasteride labelling in 2023 to include the risk of suicidal ideation as a potential psychiatric side effect.", management: "Men with a personal or family history of depression, anxiety or suicidal thoughts are specifically assessed before finasteride is prescribed. Any man who experiences mood changes, depression or suicidal thoughts while taking finasteride should seek medical help immediately and stop the medication." },
    { category: "Breast Changes", evidence: "Gynaecomastia (breast tissue enlargement) and breast tenderness are reported in approximately 0.4 to 0.5% of men taking finasteride in clinical trials.", management: "Men are instructed to report any breast swelling, tenderness or new breast lump immediately. A new breast lump in any man, including those on finasteride, is investigated as a medical priority." },
    { category: "Effects on PSA and Prostate Cancer Screening", evidence: "Finasteride reduces PSA levels by approximately 50%. Doctors interpreting PSA in men on finasteride must double the observed PSA value to estimate the true PSA level.", management: "All men over 50 who are prescribed finasteride are advised that their PSA will be suppressed.

  const faqData = [
    { q: "What is finasteride and how does it treat male pattern hair loss?", a: "Finasteride is a prescription medication primarily used to treat male pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia). Finasteride works by blocking the 5-alpha reductase enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the scalp. Reducing DHT levels in the scalp by 60 to 70% prevents further hair follicle miniaturisation and in many men promotes hair regrowth. Finasteride 1mg is the approved dose for hair loss treatment. Finasteride helps prevent further hair loss in approximately 83 to 90% of men who take it consistently." },
    { q: "How do I buy finasteride in Malaysia?", a: "To buy finasteride in Malaysia, a prescription from a registered medical doctor is required. Finasteride is a prescription medication regulated by the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) under the Ministry of Health Malaysia and is not available over the counter at a pharmacy without a prescription. A doctor must assess your suitability for finasteride before prescribing it, discuss the side effects and risks including the rare risk of suicidal ideation, and establish a monitoring plan. At Nexus Clinic KL, finasteride is prescribed after a full clinical assessment at the initial hair loss consultation." },
    { q: "What is the difference between finasteride 1mg and 5mg?", a: "Finasteride 1mg (sold under the brand name Propecia and as generic finasteride) is the dose approved for male pattern hair loss treatment. Finasteride 1mg produces approximately 60 to 70% reduction in scalp DHT levels. Finasteride 5mg (sold under the brand name Proscar) is primarily used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The 5mg dose is sometimes used off-label for hair loss when 1mg has been insufficient, but the additional DHT suppression comes with potentially greater side effect risk. At Nexus Clinic KL, finasteride 1mg is the standard starting dose." },
    { q: "What are the side effects of finasteride?", a: "Finasteride side effects include sexual side effects (decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, reduced ejaculatory volume) in approximately 1 to 2% of men in clinical trials. More serious but rare effects include Post-Finasteride Syndrome, involving persistent sexual dysfunction, cognitive changes and neuropsychiatric effects including the risk of suicidal ideation that may persist after discontinuation. Breast changes including gynaecomastia are reported in approximately 0.4 to 0.5% of men. PSA (prostate-specific antigen) is reduced by approximately 50% by finasteride. All finasteride side effects are discussed in full at the initial consultation." },
    { q: "How long does finasteride take to work?", a: "Finasteride requires consistent daily use and results develop gradually. Most men notice that hair loss slows or stops within 3 to 6 months of starting finasteride. Visible hair regrowth, where it occurs, typically begins between 6 and 12 months of continuous use. Maximum hair regrowth benefit is typically seen at 12 to 24 months. The primary benefit of finasteride for most men is stopping hair loss and keeping your hair rather than regrowing what has already been lost. Hair density photography at 6 and 12 months objectively documents whether finasteride is slowing hair loss progression." },
    { q: "Can I take finasteride and minoxidil together?", a: "Yes. Minoxidil and finasteride together are the most effective non-surgical hair restoration programme for most men with androgenetic alopecia. The two medications work through completely different biological mechanisms: finasteride blocks DHT to prevent hair follicle miniaturisation while minoxidil promotes hair regrowth by improving blood flow to hair follicles and stimulating the anagen phase directly. These mechanisms are additive and the combination produces better hair density results than either medication alone. Topical minoxidil 5% applied to the scalp alongside oral finasteride 1mg is the recommended first-line combination programme." },
    { q: "Is dutasteride better than finasteride for hair loss?", a: "Dutasteride produces greater DHT suppression than finasteride (90 to 95% vs 60 to 70%) by blocking both Type I and Type II 5-alpha reductase enzymes. Head-to-head clinical studies show dutasteride produces greater hair density improvement than finasteride. Dutasteride is available as an off-label hair loss treatment in Malaysia as the NPRA has not approved dutasteride specifically for hair loss. At Nexus Clinic KL, dutasteride is considered for men who have used finasteride for 12 months without adequate response. Dutasteride is not a first-line recommendation for all patients." },
    { q: "Can women take finasteride?", a: "Finasteride is not approved for use in women for hair loss treatment in Malaysia. A doctor may prescribe it off-label in specific circumstances for postmenopausal women with androgenetic alopecia under strict medical supervision. Women who are or may be pregnant must never handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets as the drug can be absorbed through the skin and cause birth defects in male foetuses. At Nexus Clinic KL, women presenting with hair loss are evaluated for hormonal causes including thyroid dysfunction, iron deficiency, PCOS and other treatable conditions before any off-label prescription is considered." },
    { q: "What happens if I stop taking finasteride?", a: "Stopping finasteride removes the DHT-blocking effect. After stopping finasteride, DHT levels in the scalp return to their pre-treatment levels within approximately 2 weeks. Hair loss resumes at its pre-treatment rate within 6 to 12 months of stopping finasteride. Any hair regrowth that occurred while taking finasteride is typically lost within 9 to 12 months of stopping the medication. Men who stop finasteride because they think it is not working often see rapid acceleration of hair loss within 6 months. Stopping hair loss is an ongoing process that requires continuous treatment." },
    { q: "Is the hair loss consultation at Nexus Clinic KL free?", a: "The initial hair loss assessment at Nexus Clinic KL is priced at RM 150 to RM 300 and includes a clinical hair and scalp examination, trichoscopy, hair loss pattern grading using the Norwood-Hamilton scale, medical and family history review, hormonal assessment where indicated, a full discussion of the range of treatment options including finasteride, topical minoxidil, dutasteride and PRP, a complete side effects and risks discussion for finasteride including the risk of suicidal ideation, and a personalised hair loss treatment programme recommendation with pricing before any prescription is issued." },

              The most important message from this side effects section for Malaysian men is to only take finasteride under medical supervision where a doctor has conducted the full informed consent discussion and where monitoring is available. The convenience of buying finasteride from an online pharmacy or telehealth service without an in-person consultation means that sexual side effects and mood changes are less likely to be detected and managed promptly, and that the rare but serious risk of suicidal ideation associated with finasteride is less likely to be identified before it becomes serious. At Nexus Clinic KL, every finasteride prescription includes a documented informed consent discussion, baseline assessment and structured follow-up under strict medical supervision. If at any point during finasteride treatment you experience persistent sexual dysfunction, significant mood changes, depression or any thoughts of self-harm, seek medical help immediately and stop the medication.

            The scalp assessment and hair density photography row in this programme table is the component most often absent from Malaysian hair loss treatment services, whether at a pharmacy, klinik or online telehealth platform. Without objective photographic documentation of hair density at baseline and at regular intervals, it is impossible to determine objectively whether finasteride is working for a specific patient; the gradual nature of hair loss and hair regrowth means that subjective patient assessment is unreliable; men sometimes stop finasteride because they think it is not working when objective photography would show that hair loss has stabilised or even partially improved. At Nexus Clinic KL, structured hair density photography is a standard component of every hair loss treatment programme, not an optional extra.

              Finasteride is the most effective prescription medication for stopping hair loss in men with androgenetic alopecia. The difference between taking finasteride safely and effectively and taking it unsafely is the quality of the clinical assessment, the completeness of the side effects and risks discussion, and the monitoring framework.
