  const faqData = [
    { q: "Is hair transplant treatment permanent in Malaysia?", a: "Yes. The transplanted hair is permanent because the hair follicles from the donor area are genetically DHT-resistant. Pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) is caused by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) destroying follicles in the front and crown of the scalp. The follicles at the back and sides of the scalp, which form the donor area, are not sensitive to DHT and continue growing throughout the patient's lifetime even when relocated to the recipient site. This is the biological principle of donor dominance and it is why hair transplant results are permanent while the surrounding existing hair may continue to thin over time without additional medication." },
    { q: "How many grafts will I need for my hair transplant?", a: "Graft count depends on the extent of your hair loss, the density of your donor area, and the density you want to achieve at the recipient site. As a guide, hairline restoration typically requires 1,000 to 2,000 grafts, crown area restoration needs 1,500 to 3,000 grafts, and more extensive pattern hair loss may require 3,000 to 4,500 grafts. These are estimates. The definitive number is determined at a scalp assessment by the hair transplant specialist at Nexus Clinic KL, who evaluates donor density under magnification and plans the procedure based on your specific anatomy and goals." },
    { q: "What is the difference between FUE and DHI hair transplant in Malaysia?", a: "FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction) extracts individual hair follicles from the donor area and implants them into pre-made recipient sites. DHI (Direct Hair Implantation) uses a specialised Choi pen to extract and immediately implant each follicle in a single step without pre-made incisions. DHI achieves higher graft survival rates due to reduced time outside the body, allows greater control over angle and depth at the recipient site, and requires no full head shave for most patients. FUE is appropriate for most cases and is faster for large graft counts. DHI is preferred for hairline precision and dense packing where control of each individual hair follicle is the priority." },
    { q: "What is the recovery process like after a hair transplant?", a: "The first two to three days involve mild swelling, redness, and scabbing at both the donor and recipient areas. Most patients return to desk work within three to five days. Strenuous physical activity should be avoided for two to three weeks. The transplanted hair shafts fall out within two to three weeks due to shock loss. This is expected and the follicle roots remain intact. New hair begins emerging from month three. Most patients achieve 60 to 80 percent of their final density by month eight to ten, with full results visible at month twelve to fifteen. Nexus Clinic KL provides written aftercare instructions and a direct contact line for any concerns during the recovery period." },
    { q: "Can women undergo hair transplant in Malaysia?", a: "Yes. Female hair transplant is an increasingly common procedure in Malaysia, particularly for women with traction alopecia, localised thinning along the part, or hairline recession at the temples. Women with diffuse hair loss across the entire scalp require individual assessment because diffuse patterns may not have a stable donor area free from miniaturisation. A scalp assessment at Nexus Clinic KL determines donor area suitability for female patients and ensures that hair transplant treatment is appropriate rather than inappropriate for the specific pattern of hair loss. The FUE and DHI techniques are the preferred approaches for female patients as they do not require a large shaved area." },
    { q: "How do I choose the right hair transplant clinic in Malaysia?", a: "The right hair transplant clinic is one where every surgical step is performed by a qualified hair transplant surgeon, not by nurses or technicians. Verify that the operating doctor is registered with the Malaysian Medical Council and holds relevant training in hair restoration surgery. Ask to see patient reviews and before-and-after photographs of real patients treated at the clinic, ideally patients with similar hair types and loss stages to your own. A reputable clinic will assess your scalp thoroughly before any recommendation, provide a transparent graft-count and cost breakdown, and offer a structured aftercare programme. Clinics that promise guaranteed results or instant transformations without proper assessment should be avoided." },
    { q: "Is FUE hair transplant in Malaysia painful?", a: "The procedure is performed under local anaesthesia, which means patients remain awake but do not feel pain during the transplant. The administration of the anaesthetic injections involves brief discomfort, comparable to a dental injection, after which the scalp is completely numb for the duration of the procedure. Most patients spend the session watching content on their phone or resting. Post-procedure soreness at both the donor and recipient sites typically resolves within three to five days and is managed with standard pain relief. Patients consistently report that the procedure was more comfortable than they anticipated." },
    { q: "How much does a hair transplant cost in Malaysia compared to other countries?", a: "Hair transplant cost in Malaysia is significantly lower than equivalent procedures in Western markets. A typical FUE session of 2,000 to 3,000 grafts costs approximately RM 16,000 to RM 36,000 at a quality clinic in Malaysia, compared to equivalent procedures costing RM 50,000 to RM 120,000 in Australia or the UK. This cost advantage does not reflect lower standards. Malaysia offers internationally trained surgeons, modern facilities, and Ministry of Health-regulated clinical environments at a fraction of Western overhead costs. Malaysia has become a leading destination for hair transplant medical tourism from across Asia, the Middle East, and beyond for exactly this reason." },
    { q: "What non-surgical options should I consider before committing to hair transplant?", a: "Patients at earlier stages of hair loss or those who want to preserve existing hair before surgery should discuss non-surgical options with their doctor. Minoxidil treatment and finasteride treatment are the two most clinically proven medications for slowing pattern hair loss and may stabilise the existing hair before transplant planning. PRP hair treatment can strengthen hair follicles and improve scalp health. These are not substitutes for a hair transplant where significant balding has already occurred, but they are important parts of a comprehensive hair treatment strategy." },
    { q: "What happens to the transplanted hair over time as I continue to age?", a: "The transplanted hair continues to grow permanently because it comes from DHT-resistant follicles. It will not fall out due to androgenetic alopecia. However, the existing natural hair around the transplanted area may continue to thin over time if the underlying pattern hair loss is not managed with medication. This is why many hair transplant surgeons recommend concurrent use of finasteride or minoxidil to protect the non-transplanted hair and preserve the overall density of the result over the long term. At Nexus Clinic KL, a comprehensive hair treatment plan including both surgical and medical management of hair loss is discussed at consultation to give patients the clearest picture of their long-term outcomes." },
