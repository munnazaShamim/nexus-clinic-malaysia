  const faqData = [
    { q: "How do I know which hair treatment I actually need?", a: "Start with a consultation. Most patients know the concern but not the exact treatment. The doctor will assess the pattern of hair loss, scalp condition, and stage of progression before recommending the most suitable option." },
    { q: "Can I treat hair loss without surgery?", a: "Yes. Many patients start with non-surgical options such as PRP, mesotherapy, exosome therapy, minoxidil, or finasteride. The right choice depends on whether the follicles are still active and how advanced the hair loss is." },
    { q: "When is a hair transplant the better option?", a: "Hair transplant is often considered when there is permanent loss in areas such as the front hairline, temples, crown, or beard, and when existing follicles are unlikely to recover enough with non-surgical treatment alone." },
    { q: "What is the difference between FUE hair transplant and general hair transplant?", a: "Hair transplant is the overall category. FUE is one specific method where individual follicular units are extracted and implanted with precision. It is popular because it allows natural-looking placement with minimal visible scarring." },
    { q: "Can PRP hair treatment regrow hair?", a: "PRP may help strengthen weaker follicles, improve scalp health, and support regrowth in suitable patients, especially in early or moderate thinning. Results vary depending on the condition of the follicles and the cause of hair loss." },
    { q: "Do I need both minoxidil and finasteride?", a: "Not always. Some patients use one, some use both, and some are not suitable for one of them. The recommendation depends on your pattern of loss, gender, medical history, and treatment goals." },
    { q: "How long does it take to see results from hair treatment?", a: "Hair treatment takes time. Some patients notice reduced shedding first, then gradual improvement in density over the following months. Most hair restoration treatments require consistency and realistic expectations." },
    { q: "Are hair treatments at Nexus Clinic KL doctor-led?", a: "Yes. At Nexus Clinic KL, all hair treatment plans begin with doctor assessment so suitability, safety, and realistic outcomes can be discussed clearly before treatment starts." },
    { q: "Can beard transplant look natural?", a: "Yes, when designed properly. Beard transplant uses carefully placed grafts to match the direction, angle, and pattern of natural facial hair growth." },
    { q: "Where is Nexus Clinic KL located?", a: "Nexus Clinic KL is located at Wisma UOA II, Jalan Pinang, Kuala Lumpur, with convenient access for patients visiting from KLCC and surrounding areas." },

            Hair loss can happen gradually or all at once. For some people, it starts with more hair on the pillow 
            or in the shower. For others, it shows up as a receding hairline, thinning at the crown, patchy beard 
            growth, or overall loss of density.
            <br /><br />
            At Nexus Clinic KL, every hair treatment starts with a proper assessment. We look at the pattern of hair 
            loss, possible causes, scalp condition, and your treatment goals before recommending what actually makes 
            sense for you. From medical treatments to regenerative options and hair transplant solutions, our approach 
            is always doctor-led, clear, and personalized.

            Hair loss is not one single condition. Some patients experience early thinning caused by genetics. 
            Some notice sudden shedding after stress, illness, hormonal change, or poor scalp health. Others 
            come in because the front hairline has moved back slowly over time, the crown has become thinner, 
            or beard growth has remained patchy.

            What matters is not just where the hair loss appears, but why it is happening. At Nexus Clinic 
            Kuala Lumpur, hair treatment begins with diagnosis, not guesswork. Our doctors assess the pattern 
            of loss, the strength of existing follicles, the condition of the scalp, and whether the concern 
            is best treated with medication, regenerative therapy, transplant planning, or a combination approach. 
            The goal is simple: protect existing hair, improve density where possible, and recommend the right 
            treatment based on the stage of hair loss.

                There are many clinics offering hair treatments in Kuala Lumpur. The names of the treatments may 
                sound familiar from clinic to clinic, but the real difference is in how the decision is made.

              <p className="text-brown font-inter leading-relaxed">
                At Nexus Clinic KL, we do not recommend treatment based only on trend, package, or assumption. 
                Every hair consultation is built around diagnosis. We assess whether the follicles are still active, 
                whether loss is progressing, and whether the concern should be treated medically, regeneratively, 
                surgically, or with a staged combination plan.

              <p className="text-brown font-inter leading-relaxed mb-4">
                We explain what each option can do, what it cannot do, and what kind of maintenance may be needed. 
                If a transplant is too early, we will say so. If medication is more important than a procedure, 
                we will say that too. Our goal is not to sell the most treatment. It is to recommend the right one.

              Many patients assume there is one best treatment for hair loss. In reality, the right plan often 
              depends on whether the goal is to slow ongoing loss, improve current density, restore a hairline, 
              or maintain transplant results.
              <br /><br />
              For example, a patient with early thinning may benefit most from medical support such as minoxidil 
              or finasteride, together with regenerative treatments like PRP. A patient with a more advanced 
              receding hairline may need transplant planning for visible restoration, while also using medical 
              treatment to protect the remaining hair.
              <br /><br />
              At Nexus Clinic KL, we build treatment plans around short-term improvement and long-term maintenance. 
              That is what creates better, more stable results.
