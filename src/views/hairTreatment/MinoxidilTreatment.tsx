  // Mechanism of Action Table
  const mechanismTable = [
    {
      step: "Blood Vessel Dilation in the Scalp",
      mechanism: "Minoxidil is a potassium channel opener that causes smooth muscle cells in blood vessel walls to relax; this relaxation dilates the blood vessels supplying the hair follicles in the scalp.",
      effect: "Improved blood flow delivers more oxygen and nutrients to reach the hair follicle, providing the metabolic substrate needed for the energy-intensive anagen hair growth phase.",
      implication: "At Nexus Clinic KL, minoxidil's vascular mechanism complements PRP therapy, targeting the hair follicle from two complementary directions."
    },
    {
      step: "Anagen Phase Extension",
      mechanism: "Minoxidil extends the growth phase of the hair growth cycle, keeping more hair follicles in active anagen for longer periods.",
      effect: "As more follicles spend more time in anagen simultaneously, hair density visible on the scalp increases because at any given moment more follicles are actively producing a visible hair shaft.",
      implication: "Patients are counselled that initial hair fall in the first 4-8 weeks is caused by telogen-phase hairs being pushed out early to make way for new anagen-phase hair growth."
    },
    {
      step: "Direct Hair Follicle Keratinocyte Stimulation",
      mechanism: "Minoxidil directly stimulates proliferation of hair follicle keratinocytes and upregulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in the follicle.",
      effect: "Minoxidil works even in follicles with adequate blood supply by directly accelerating hair follicle cell division. VEGF upregulation creates a sustained angiogenic effect that builds over time.",
      implication: "Individual variability in scalp sulphotransferase enzyme activity explains why some patients respond much better to minoxidil than others."
    },
    {
      step: "Initial Shedding and New Hair Growth Sequence",
      mechanism: "Minoxidil pushes hair follicles that have been in a prolonged or premature telogen phase into a new anagen cycle; the old telogen hair must shed before new anagen hair can emerge.",
      effect: "The new hair growth that emerges following this shedding phase is the actual therapeutic effect of minoxidil, producing long-term hair regrowth benefit.",
      implication: "Pre-treatment counselling about the initial shedding phase is mandatory at every minoxidil consultation to prevent premature treatment cessation."
    },
  ];

  const genderTable = [
    {
      factor: "Pattern of Hair Loss Addressed",
      men: "Androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness) presenting as receding hairline and progressive crown thinning following Norwood-Hamilton classification.",
      women: "Female pattern hair loss presenting as diffuse hair thinning over the crown with preserved hairline following Ludwig classification."
    },
    {
      factor: "Concentration Recommended",
      men: "Minoxidil 5% topical solution or foam is the standard concentration. The higher concentration produces greater hair regrowth and hair density improvement than 2%.",
      women: "Minoxidil 2% is the traditional concentration. Minoxidil 5% is increasingly used under medical guidance, particularly for women not achieving adequate results on 2%."
    },
    {
      factor: "Role of Finasteride",
      men: "Combining minoxidil with finasteride is the most effective non-surgical approach. Minoxidil promotes growth while finasteride addresses the primary hormonal cause.",
      women: "Finasteride is not recommended for women of reproductive age. Women with PCOS or androgen excess may benefit from spironolactone combined with minoxidil."
    },
    {
      factor: "Oral Minoxidil Option",
      men: "Low-dose oral minoxidil (2.5 to 5mg daily) is increasingly prescribed for men who find topical application inconvenient or are poor topical responders.",
      women: "Very low-dose oral minoxidil (0.625 to 2.5mg daily) is increasingly used, particularly for older women who prefer oral medication over daily topical application."
    },
    {
      factor: "Best Results Programme",
      men: "Minoxidil 5% topical or oral combined with finasteride 1mg plus PRP hair treatment (3 sessions) for comprehensive approach addressing blood flow, DHT suppression and follicle regeneration.",
      women: "Minoxidil 2-5% topical or low-dose oral combined with PRP and scalp mesotherapy, plus hormonal assessment to identify and treat any contributing hormonal imbalance."

  // Topical vs Oral Minoxidil Comparison Table
  const formulationTable = [
    {
      factor: "Delivery and Application",
      topical: "Applied directly to scalp once or twice daily using dropper, pump or foam applicator. Must be applied to dry scalp and allowed to dry for at least 4 hours before washing.",
      oral: "Taken as oral medication once daily at low dose (0.625 to 5mg depending on patient profile). Bypasses scalp sulphotransferase conversion step that limits topical efficacy."
    },
    {
      factor: "Effectiveness",
      topical: "FDA-approved for male androgenetic alopecia. Clinical trials show approximately 60-70% of men maintaining or improving hair count at 12 months. Response varies with scalp sulphotransferase enzyme activity.",
      oral: "Produces comparable or superior hair density improvement to topical. Less affected by scalp sulphotransferase variability because conversion occurs systemically in the liver."
    },
    {
      factor: "Side Effect Profile",
      topical: "Side effects rare at standard concentrations. Most common: scalp irritation, contact dermatitis, scalp dryness. Unwanted facial hair uncommon. Systemic absorption low.",
      oral: "Side effects at low doses include fluid retention (ankle swelling, weight gain), facial hair growth (hypertrichosis), reflex tachycardia, mild blood pressure lowering. Requires monitoring."
    },
    {
      factor: "Who Should Consider",
      topical: "Most patients beginning treatment for first time; patients wanting to minimise systemic medication; patients comfortable with twice-daily scalp application.",
      oral: "Patients who find topical application inconvenient; patients with inadequate topical response after 6 months; patients with scalp irritation from topical; patients with active lifestyles."

    },
    {
      component: "Finasteride (for Male Patients)",
      role: "Adds DHT-blocking mechanism. Stops underlying cause while minoxidil stimulates growth cycle. Combination produces additive improvement in hair density.",

  // FAQ Data
  const faqData = [
    { q: "What is minoxidil and how does it work for hair loss?", a: "Minoxidil is a vasodilator medication originally developed to treat high blood pressure; its hair growth-promoting effect was discovered as a side effect. Minoxidil works by dilating blood vessels in the scalp to allow more oxygen and nutrients to reach the hair follicles, extending the anagen (active growth) phase of the hair growth cycle. Minoxidil is a topical solution or foam applied directly to the scalp or taken as an oral medication once daily. It is used to treat androgenetic alopecia in both men and women and is one of the two most evidence-supported medications for hair loss treatment alongside finasteride." },
    { q: "How long does minoxidil take to work for hair regrowth?", a: "Minoxidil requires consistent use over several months to produce visible hair regrowth. Most patients experience an initial hair fall in the first 4 to 8 weeks as telogen-phase hair follicles are pushed into new anagen growth cycles; this initial shedding is evidence that minoxidil is working and should not prompt stopping treatment. Visible new hair growth typically appears at 3 to 6 months. Significant improvement is usually seen at 6 to 12 months of consistent use. Maximum effectiveness is seen at 12 months. Minoxidil must be continued indefinitely to maintain the hair density benefit." },
    { q: "What is the difference between topical and oral minoxidil?", a: "Topical minoxidil is applied directly to the scalp once or twice daily; it delivers the vasodilatory effect locally with minimal systemic absorption. Minoxidil 5% is the standard concentration for men. Oral minoxidil is taken as an oral medication once daily at a low dose; it produces more consistent delivery of the active minoxidil form because it bypasses the scalp sulphotransferase conversion step that limits topical effectiveness in some patients. Oral minoxidil is increasingly used for patients who find topical application inconvenient, have scalp irritation, or are inadequate topical responders. Both formulations require medical supervision." },
    { q: "Can I use minoxidil and finasteride together?", a: "Yes; minoxidil and finasteride together produce the best results for men with androgenetic alopecia compared to either treatment alone. The two medications address hair loss through completely different mechanisms: minoxidil promotes hair growth by improving blood flow and extending the growth phase, while finasteride blocks the DHT hormone that causes androgenetic alopecia. These mechanisms are fully complementary and the combination produces additive improvement in hair density, hair regrowth and slowing of hair loss progression. At Nexus Clinic KL, the minoxidil and finasteride combination is the standard treatment plan for eligible men." },
    { q: "Is minoxidil safe for women?", a: "Yes; minoxidil is one of the safest and most evidence-supported hair loss treatment options for women. Minoxidil 2% is the traditional concentration recommended for women and minoxidil 5% is increasingly used with adequate medical guidance. The most common side effect in women is unwanted facial hair growth (hypertrichosis), which is more common with 5% than 2% and resolves after stopping the medication. Scalp irritation may occur with the topical solution and is usually managed by switching to the foam formulation. Oral minoxidil at very low dose (0.625mg to 2.5mg) is an option for women who prefer oral medication." },
    { q: "Why is my hair falling out after starting minoxidil?", a: "Initial hair fall in the first 4 to 8 weeks of minoxidil use is an expected and normal part of how minoxidil works. When minoxidil is applied to the scalp, it pushes hair follicles that are in a prolonged or premature telogen (resting) phase into a new anagen (growth) cycle; the old telogen hair must shed before new anagen hair can emerge. This shedding phase is not minoxidil causing damage; it is the transition process that produces the long-term hair regrowth benefit. New hair growth emerges at 3 to 6 months following this initial shedding. At Nexus Clinic KL, every patient receives pre-treatment counselling about the initial shedding." },
    { q: "Where can I buy minoxidil in Malaysia?", a: "Topical minoxidil 5% for men is available from most pharmacies in Malaysia without a prescription, sold under various brand names and as generic formulations. Oral minoxidil requires a prescription from a registered medical doctor and is not available over the counter. At Nexus Clinic KL, the appropriate minoxidil formulation, concentration and dosing schedule is determined at the initial consultation and prescribed with a treatment plan and monitoring schedule. Medical guidance is recommended for all patients starting minoxidil, particularly those combining it with finasteride or oral medication." },
    { q: "How does PRP complement minoxidil treatment?", a: "PRP (platelet-rich plasma) hair treatment adds growth factors directly to the scalp environment alongside minoxidil's blood flow mechanism. Minoxidil improves blood flow to allow more oxygen and nutrients to reach the hair follicles, while PRP delivers PDGF, VEGF and TGF-beta growth factors that directly stimulate hair follicle cell proliferation through a different biological pathway. Together, minoxidil and PRP target hair follicle health from two complementary angles and consistently produce better hair density and hair regrowth outcomes than either treatment alone." },
    { q: "How long do I need to use minoxidil?", a: "Minoxidil must be used indefinitely to maintain the hair density benefit. When minoxidil is stopped, the improved blood flow and extended anagen phase effect gradually disappears. Hair loss resumes at its pre-treatment rate within several months of stopping minoxidil. Any new hair growth achieved during minoxidil use is typically lost within 3 to 6 months of stopping. This is why minoxidil is a long-term hair care commitment rather than a short course of treatment. At Nexus Clinic KL, patients are counselled that minoxidil is a lifelong treatment commitment for those who want to maintain their hair density." },
    { q: "Is the minoxidil consultation at Nexus Clinic KL worth having?", a: "Yes; the medical consultation provides value beyond pharmacy-dispensed minoxidil in several important ways: the expert hair assessment confirms the correct diagnosis before any treatment is started; the consultation determines whether topical or oral minoxidil is more appropriate; pre-treatment counselling about initial shedding prevents the single most common reason for treatment failure; the combination of minoxidil with finasteride for men and PRP for both sexes produces significantly better outcomes; and standardised hair density photography confirms the treatment works and guides programme adjustments." },
    { q: "Can minoxidil cause unwanted facial hair?", a: "Yes, it can, especially if the product spreads to nearby skin or drips. Unwanted hair growth on adjacent skin is a possible side effect of topical minoxidil. Clean application, careful drying, and thorough hand-washing after each use reduce this risk. If unwanted facial hair occurs, it typically resolves after stopping the medication or adjusting the application technique. At Nexus Clinic KL, proper application technique is demonstrated at the initial consultation to minimise this risk." },
    { q: "Is minoxidil dangerous to pets?", a: "Yes, topical minoxidil can be highly toxic to pets, especially cats, and even small exposure can be serious. Medical literature highlights that pets can be affected by minoxidil residue on pillowcases, hands, or the scalp itself. Simple safety habits include washing hands thoroughly after every use, letting the scalp dry fully before touching pets, keeping bottles locked away, and changing pillowcases often if applying at night. If you have pets that sleep on your pillow or lick your hair, discuss safer routines and strict precautions with your doctor." },

              The scalp sulphotransferase enzyme variability row is the most clinically novel content for Malaysian patients. The reason some patients get excellent hair density improvement while others get minimal response is primarily explained by individual differences in the scalp enzyme that converts topical minoxidil to its active form. At Nexus Clinic KL, this variability is the clinical rationale for switching to oral minoxidil in patients with inadequate topical response.
