  // FAQ Data
  const faqData = [
    { q: "What exactly is injected into the scalp during hair mesotherapy?", a: "The contents of the mesotherapy injection are a customized cocktail of medical-grade active substances tailored to the patient's specific hair loss pattern. The base formulation includes biotin and B-complex vitamins to support follicle metabolism, amino acids such as cysteine and taurine as building blocks for hair protein, minerals including zinc, copper, and selenium that regulate follicle enzyme activity, and growth factors that stimulate cell proliferation. For patients with DHT-driven androgenetic alopecia, the cocktail may include DHT-blocking compounds. The specific composition is determined by the doctor at the initial consultation." },
    { q: "How many mesotherapy sessions does hair thinning require?", a: "The number of sessions required depends on the cause and severity of hair thinning. Patients with mild to moderate hair thinning caused by nutritional deficiency or postpartum shedding typically respond after three to four sessions and complete a course of six sessions. Patients with androgenetic alopecia that has been progressing for several years generally need eight to ten sessions for meaningful improvement and quarterly maintenance sessions thereafter. Your doctor will assess the scalp condition and provide a session plan at the first consultation." },
    { q: "Is mesotherapy for hair loss painful?", a: "Mesotherapy is described as essentially painless by the majority of patients at Nexus Clinic KL, primarily because a topical numbing cream is applied to the scalp before every session. The numbing cream requires approximately 20 minutes to take effect and significantly reduces the sensation of the microinjections. Patients typically report only mild pressure or minor tingling at each injection point rather than pain. Post-session scalp sensitivity is mild and resolves within 24 to 48 hours." },
    { q: "Can mesotherapy be combined with PRP or other hair loss treatments?", a: "Yes, and combination approaches generally produce better outcomes. Mesotherapy provides the nutritional and hormonal environment for follicle recovery, while PRP adds a concentrated growth factor signal from the patient's own blood. Combining both treatments in an alternating session schedule addresses hair loss from complementary biological directions. Mesotherapy can also be combined with laser booster therapy for enhanced scalp microcirculation, and with oral medications like minoxidil or finasteride to address the systemic hormonal component of androgenetic alopecia." },
    { q: "How soon will I see results from hair mesotherapy?", a: "Most patients notice a reduction in daily hair shedding within the first three to four sessions, which is typically the earliest measurable sign that mesotherapy is working. Improvement in scalp health, reduction in scalp oiliness or sensitivity, and early signs of new hair growth become visible from month two to three of a regular treatment schedule. Improved hair density and thickness develops progressively over the full six to ten session course, with the most complete result visible at six months from the start of the programme." },
    { q: "Is mesotherapy suitable for all forms of hair loss?", a: "Mesotherapy is most effective for androgenetic alopecia (pattern hair loss), diffuse hair thinning from nutritional deficiency or hormonal imbalance, postpartum hair loss, and stress or illness-related shedding. Mesotherapy can help patients at early to moderate stages of these conditions, where viable follicles are still present but underperforming. It is less effective for alopecia areata where the immune attack on follicles requires additional therapeutic approaches, and it is not suitable for completely bald areas where follicles have been permanently destroyed." },
    { q: "What is the difference between mesotherapy and PRP for hair loss?", a: "Mesotherapy delivers a customized cocktail of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and pharmaceutically active compounds to the scalp layer via microinjections. The composition can be tailored precisely to the patient's diagnosis. PRP (platelet-rich plasma) uses a concentrated preparation of the patient's own blood, which is rich in growth factors but cannot be ingredient-customised in the same way. Mesotherapy is generally better for nutritional deficiency and DHT-inhibition applications, while PRP delivers a stronger growth factor stimulus for follicle reactivation." },
    { q: "Can mesotherapy be used for facial skin rejuvenation as well as hair loss?", a: "Yes. The mesotherapy technique used for hair loss is the same minimally invasive injection technique applied to facial skin for skin rejuvenation, wrinkle reduction, and improvement of the signs of aging. For facial applications, the customized cocktail typically contains hyaluronic acid, collagen-stimulating peptides, vitamins C and E, and amino acids that rejuvenate the skin from within the dermis. Patients at Nexus Clinic KL can receive both hair and facial mesotherapy at the same visit." },
    { q: "Is there any downtime after a mesotherapy hair session?", a: "Mesotherapy has no meaningful downtime. Patients return directly to work and daily activities after the session. The scalp may appear slightly flushed and feel mildly tender for 24 to 48 hours, which is the expected inflammatory response to the microinjections and is a sign the treatment is working. Most patients choose not to wash their hair on the day of treatment to allow maximum absorption of the injected cocktail. No bandaging, rest, or special accommodation is required." },
    { q: "What are the side effects of scalp mesotherapy?", a: "Most side effects are mild and temporary, including redness, swelling, tenderness at injection sites, and mild scalp sensitivity that typically settles within a few days. Like any injection-based procedure, rare risks can include infection or allergic reaction. Medical literature also notes possible local reactions such as pain, itching, edema, hematoma, folliculitis, and rare inflammatory complications. This is why sterile technique and medical oversight at Nexus Clinic KL matter." },

              <p className="text-taupe font-inter">Mesotherapy is a procedure in aesthetic medicine that involves injecting active substances directly into the mesoderm, the middle layer of the skin, using fine-gauge needles.</p>
              <p className="text-taupe font-inter">For hair loss treatment, hair mesotherapy delivers a customized cocktail of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and growth factors directly into the scalp at the level of the dermal papilla and hair follicle base.</p>
              <p className="text-taupe font-inter">Because the active ingredients are delivered directly to their target zone rather than absorbed through the gut or diffusing through the skin, mesotherapy achieves follicle-level concentrations that neither oral nor topical treatments can consistently replicate.</p>
