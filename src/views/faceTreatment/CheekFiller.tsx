  const faqData = [
    { q: "How long does cheek filler last in Malaysia?", a: "Juvederm Voluma, the most prescribed cheek filler in Malaysia, typically lasts 12 to 18 months. Radiesse can last 12 to 24 months. Individual metabolism, lifestyle and the volume used all affect longevity. Patients who maintain regular top-up sessions typically find that each subsequent session requires less product as residual filler from the previous treatment remains in the tissue." },
    { q: "How much does cheek filler cost in Malaysia in 2026?", a: "Cheek filler treatments at Nexus Clinic KL typically range from RM 2,400 to RM 3,000+ per session, depending on the product used and the volume required for contouring or volume restoration. More advanced treatments requiring higher volume or multi-area facial balancing can range from RM 3,000 to RM 5,000+. Final pricing is confirmed during consultation based on your facial structure and treatment goals." },
    { q: "How much filler is needed for the cheeks?", a: "Most patients need 1 to 2ml per side for a natural, proportionate cheek filler result. First-time patients with good existing cheek structure wanting subtle contouring may need only 1ml per side. Patients with significant age-related volume loss may require 2 to 3ml per side. The doctor confirms the right volume at consultation based on your face shape and the degree of correction needed." },
    { q: "Will cheek filler make my face look too round or puffy?", a: "Correctly placed cheek filler creates definition and lift, not roundness or puffiness. An overfilled, puffy appearance is caused by too much volume placed too superficially or in the wrong anatomical zone. At Nexus Clinic KL, the approach is anatomy-first and restrained, focusing on medical aesthetic principles. The goal is to restore the natural Ogee curve and cheek position, not to overfill the face. Many patients find that cheek filler makes their face look slimmer and more defined, not rounder." },
    { q: "Can cheek filler help with nasolabial folds?", a: "Yes. Nasolabial folds deepen significantly when cheek volume drops because the weight of deflated cheeks pulls downward on the skin above the fold. Restoring cheek volume lifts this skin from above and reduces fold depth without directly injecting the nasolabial fold area. Many patients find their smile lines improve significantly after cheek filler, as it helps to restore volume before any fold-specific treatment is considered." },
    { q: "Does cheek filler improve under-eye hollowing?", a: "Often yes, though the degree of improvement depends on the depth of the tear trough and how much of it is contributed by cheek descent versus direct under-eye hollowing. Restoring cheek volume provides structural support to the lower eyelid area and can significantly reduce the visible tear trough. Patients with significant under-eye hollowing may still benefit from dedicated tear trough filler after cheek treatment." },
    { q: "Can cheek filler be dissolved?", a: "Hyaluronic acid cheek fillers are fully dissolvable with hyaluronidase. If you are unhappy with the result for any reason, the filler can be partially or completely removed. Radiesse is not reversible with hyaluronidase and requires more thorough patient assessment before use. For first-time patients, HA filler is always the recommended starting option due to its reversibility." },
    { q: "Is cheek filler suitable for men?", a: "Yes. Cheek filler for men is a growing treatment category at Nexus Clinic KL. Male patients want stronger zygomatic projection and defined cheekbones rather than rounded apple cheeks. The product selection, injection depth and placement zones differ significantly from female technique. Juvederm Volux and Radiesse are the preferred products for male patients due to their firmer structural profile. Results look masculine and natural when the technique is gender-appropriate." },
    { q: "How soon will I see results from cheek filler?", a: "Results are visible immediately after treatment. Mild swelling over the first 24 to 48 hours may slightly exaggerate the initial volume. As swelling resolves over 7 to 14 days, the final settled result becomes visible. Most patients see their best outcome at the two-week review. The secondary cascade effects on nasolabial folds and under-eyes become clearer as the filler fully integrates with surrounding tissue." },
    { q: "Who is not suitable for cheek filler?", a: "Cheek filler is not suitable for patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, have an active skin infection in the treatment area, have a known allergy to hyaluronic acid or lidocaine, or have certain autoimmune conditions affecting healing. Patients with very thin facial skin or who have had cheek implants previously are assessed case by case. A full medical assessment at consultation determines suitability for each individual." },

                How Asian Midface Aging Differs — <span className="text-wine italic">Why Cheek Filler Matters Earlier</span>
              </h2>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                Cheek filler is not just an anti-aging treatment; it can also add volume, improve facial contour, and enhance skin texture. 
                For Asian patients including the majority of those seen at Nexus Clinic KL, it is often the most structurally impactful 
                facial filler treatment available.
              </p>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                Research in aesthetic medicine has shown that Asian patients typically experience midface volume loss earlier than their 
                Western counterparts, often beginning in the mid-twenties. Asian cheekbones tend to project laterally outward rather than 
                anteriorly forward, making volume loss more visually impactful.
              </p>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                At Nexus Clinic KL, cheek filler placement is planned specifically for Southeast Asian facial anatomy. Volume is placed 
                medially at the anteromedial cheek and submalar zones rather than laterally, creating a natural, lifted appearance.

              Your cheeks do more for your face than most patients realise. Restoring their structure lifts the eyes, 
              softens smile lines, and resets the balance of your entire face.

              One consultation at Nexus Clinic KL is enough to understand exactly what cheek filler can achieve for your specific anatomy.
