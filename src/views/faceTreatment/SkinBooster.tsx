  const faqData = [
    { q: "How long does skin booster treatment last in Malaysia?", a: "Longevity varies by product. Profhilo results typically last six months. Rejuran Healer and Plinest last six to nine months. Juvelook provides the longest-lasting results at 12 to 18 months due to its collagen-stimulating PDLLA component. NCTF 135HA requires maintenance every three to six months. Individual metabolism, sun exposure and skincare habits all affect how long results last." },
    { q: "How much does skin booster treatment cost in Malaysia in 2026?", a: "Skin booster prices at Nexus Clinic KL typically range from RM 1,800 to RM 2,500 per session depending on the product used and treatment area. Advanced skin remodelling treatments such as Profhilo are typically priced around RM 2,500 per session, while other skin booster treatments generally fall within the RM 1,800 to RM 2,200 range. Most treatments require multiple sessions for optimal results. Final pricing is confirmed after consultation based on your skin condition and goals." },
    { q: "Which skin booster is best for acne scars in Malaysia?", a: "Rejuran Healer is the most effective skin booster for improving acne scar texture and depth. Its polynucleotide formula stimulates cell regeneration and tissue repair, gradually filling shallow to moderate rolling and boxcar scars over three to four sessions. Juvelook is an alternative for scars where collagen loss contributes to the indentation, as its PDLLA component rebuilds the surrounding collagen matrix. Many patients benefit from combining both treatments in a staged protocol." },
    { q: "What is the difference between skin booster and dermal filler?", a: "Skin boosters improve the overall quality of the skin across the full treatment area. They target hydration, texture, collagen content and radiance. They do not add volume or reshape facial structure. Dermal fillers add volume to specific areas to restore lost structure or contour the face. Skin boosters are injected superficially into the dermis. Fillers are placed more deeply into subcutaneous tissue. The two treatments address different concerns and are frequently used together." },
    { q: "How many sessions of skin booster are needed?", a: "Most skin boosters require two to four sessions for initial results. Profhilo uses the fewest sessions at two, spaced four weeks apart. Rejuran, Juvelook, NCTF and Plinest typically require three to four sessions spaced two to four weeks apart. After the initial protocol, most patients maintain their results with sessions every three to six months depending on the product used." },
    { q: "Is Rejuran safe for Muslim patients in Malaysia?", a: "Rejuran Healer contains polynucleotides derived from highly purified salmon DNA. The purification process removes proteins and most allergens. Islamic scholars and medical authorities in Malaysia have generally considered the use of highly purified pharmaceutical-grade salmon DNA in medical treatment permissible due to the extent of processing involved. Plinest, derived from trout rather than salmon, is available as an alternative for patients who prefer a non-salmon PN booster." },
    { q: "Can skin booster be done during pregnancy or breastfeeding?", a: "No. Skin booster treatment is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. While the risk of systemic absorption of injectable hyaluronic acid or polynucleotides is considered very low, there are no clinical trials supporting safety in pregnant or breastfeeding patients. The precautionary approach at Nexus Clinic KL is to defer all non-essential injectable treatments until after pregnancy and breastfeeding have concluded." },
    { q: "How long before an event should I book skin booster treatment?", a: "For Profhilo, book at least two to three weeks before a significant event to allow both sessions to be completed and the initial injection marks to resolve. For Rejuran and other PN boosters, allow four to six weeks before the event to see meaningful improvement. For a big event like a wedding, the ideal plan is to start a full protocol three to four months in advance for the best accumulated result from multiple sessions." },
    { q: "Is skin booster treatment painful?", a: "Skin boosters are administered with very fine needles into the upper dermis. Most patients describe the sensation as a series of tiny pinches rather than significant pain. Topical numbing cream can be applied before treatment on request. The treatment takes 20 to 30 minutes. There is no recovery period and most patients return to normal activities immediately." },

                How Skin Booster Injections Work and <span className="text-wine">What They Actually Fix</span>
              </h2>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                A skin booster is an injectable treatment that delivers active ingredients into the mid to deep dermis using very fine needles. 
                Unlike <Link  href='/face/dermal-filler-malaysia/' className='font-bold text-wine italic'>dermal filler </Link>, which adds volume and structure to specific areas, skin boosters are distributed across the full treatment area.
              </p>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                The key distinction is that skin boosters target skin quality while fillers target facial structure. 
                A patient whose skin looks dull, dehydrated and aged regardless of the shape of their face needs a skin booster.

Global aesthetic market analyses also project that the skin boosters sector (injectable treatments designed to improve hydration, elasticity, and skin quality) is expanding rapidly worldwide and across the Asia‑Pacific region, with industry forecasts highlighting double‑digit market growth and increasing adoption of these minimally invasive treatments.

              Skincare reaches the surface. Skin boosters reach the dermis. If your skin looks dull, dry, textured or tired 
              despite a consistent routine, the answer is treatment at the level where the problem actually lives.
            </p>
            <p className="text-cream/90 font-inter">
              One consultation at Nexus Clinic KL is enough to identify exactly which booster addresses your skin concern, 
              how many sessions you need and what a realistic result looks like for your skin type.
