  const faqData = [
    { q: "What is the difference between under eye filler and tear trough filler?", a: "They are the same treatment referred to by two different names. Under eye filler is the consumer-friendly term most patients use when searching. Tear trough filler is the clinical term used by aesthetic doctors. The tear trough is the anatomical name for the hollow groove between the lower eyelid and the upper cheek. Both terms describe the same procedure: placing soft HA filler in this groove to restore volume and reduce the shadow it creates." },
    { q: "How long does under eye filler last in Malaysia?", a: "Under eye filler typically lasts 9 to 15 months. The under-eye area has minimal muscle movement, which means filler metabolises more slowly here than in high-movement areas like the lips. Soft products like Belotero Balance often persist for over a year in many patients. Your doctor will advise on expected longevity based on the product used and your individual metabolism." },
    { q: "How much does under eye filler cost in Malaysia in 2026?", a: "Under-eye filler at Nexus Clinic KL typically ranges from RM 2,200 to RM 2,600 per session depending on the product used and the level of correction required. Combination treatments involving under-eye and midface support, such as cheek enhancement, generally range from RM 3,000 to RM 5,000+ depending on the volume and areas treated. All pricing is confirmed after consultation to ensure safe and personalised treatment planning." },
    { q: "Will under eye filler remove my dark circles?", a: "If your dark circles are caused by hollow shadows from a sunken under-eye, filler significantly reduces or eliminates the appearance of dark circles by filling the hollow and removing the shadow. If your dark circles are caused by brown pigmentation or visible blood vessels through thin skin, filler improves the appearance partially but does not address the root cause. Many patients benefit from a combination of filler for structure and a skin treatment for skin quality." },
    { q: "Is under eye filler safe?", a: "Under eye filler is safe when performed by a trained medical doctor using the correct product and technique in a proper clinical setting. The under-eye area carries specific risks including the Tyndall effect from superficial placement and rare vascular complications. Both are manageable with the right product selection, deep cannula technique and emergency protocols in place. At Nexus Clinic KL, all under-eye filler treatments follow these protocols without exception." },
    { q: "How much filler is needed for the under eyes?", a: "Most patients need 0.3 to 0.8ml per side. This is one of the lowest-volume areas on the face and it should remain so. More than 0.8ml per side in a single under-eye session is rarely appropriate and increases the risk of puffiness, migration, and the Tyndall effect. A conservative first session with a top-up if needed at two weeks is always safer than starting with high volumes." },
    { q: "Can I get under eye filler if I have eye bags?", a: "It depends on the nature of the eye bag. If the puffiness is caused by fat herniation, meaning a visible bulge beneath the eye, adding filler may worsen the appearance by adding volume to an already protruding area. If the eye bag is largely a shadow caused by the hollow below a mild protrusion, filling the hollow can significantly improve the appearance by reducing contrast. The doctor assesses this at consultation." },
    { q: "Can I combine under eye filler with other treatments?", a: "Yes. Under eye filler combines well with cheek filler for patients where midface descent is contributing to the hollow, skin booster treatments for improving under-eye skin quality alongside structural correction, and Pico laser for pigmentation-based dark circles. Combining these treatments produces a more complete result than filler alone when multiple causes are present." },
    { q: "How soon can I wear eye make-up after under eye filler?", a: "You can apply eye make-up gently from the day after treatment. Avoid pressing, rubbing or applying heavy creams near the injection site for 48 hours. Remove eye make-up gently during this period, patting rather than wiping. Normal eye make-up application can resume fully after 48 hours." },
    { q: "Who is not suitable for under eye filler?", a: "Under eye filler is not suitable for patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, have an active skin infection near the treatment area, have very thin under-eye skin prone to the Tyndall effect, have significant fat herniation as the primary eye bag concern, have a known allergy to HA or lidocaine, or have had large volumes of non-HA filler placed under the eyes previously that have not been dissolved. A full assessment at consultation confirms suitability." },

              Most patients presenting at Nexus Clinic KL with under-eye concerns benefit from a combination of two approaches. Filler for the structural hollow is the most common starting point, often paired with a skin booster to address skin quality and vascular visibility in the same zone. Patients with significant brown pigmentation as well as hollowing are advised to treat the structural component first, then address pigmentation with laser once the filler has settled.

             The best time to address under-eye hollowing is when you first notice it. A smaller volume of filler placed at an earlier stage produces a more natural result and requires less correction over time than waiting until the hollow has become deep and settled.
            Patients who also notice cheek descent alongside their under-eye hollowing often benefit from combining under eye filler with <Link  href='/face/cheek-filler-malaysia/' className='font-bold text-wine italic'>cheek filler treatment </Link> at Nexus Clinic KL for a more complete result.
