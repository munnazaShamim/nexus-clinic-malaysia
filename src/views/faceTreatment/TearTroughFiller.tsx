  const faqData = [
    { q: "Will tear trough filler remove my dark circles?", a: "It depends entirely on what is causing your dark circles. If your dark circles are caused by hollowness and shadow from a sunken tear trough, filler will significantly improve them. If they are caused by brown pigmentation from excess melanin, filler will not help. If they are caused by blue-purple vascular showing through thin skin, filler provides partial improvement at best. The doctor diagnoses your dark circle type at consultation before recommending treatment." },
    { q: "How long does tear trough filler last in Malaysia?", a: "Tear trough filler typically lasts 9 to 15 months. The under-eye area has very little muscle movement, which means the filler breaks down more slowly than in high-movement areas like the lips. Some patients report maintained improvement for over 12 months with soft products like Belotero. Individual metabolism and the product used affect longevity." },
    { q: "How much does tear trough filler cost in Malaysia in 2026?", a: "Tear trough filler at Nexus Clinic KL typically ranges from RM 2,200 to RM 2,600 per session depending on the product used and the level of correction required. Combined tear trough and midface treatments, such as cheek support, generally range from RM 3,000 to RM 5,000+ depending on the volume and areas treated. All pricing is confirmed after consultation to ensure safe and personalised treatment planning." },
    { q: "Is tear trough filler safe?", a: "When performed by a trained medical doctor with the correct product and technique in a proper clinical setting, tear trough filler has a strong safety record. The most common complications, the Tyndall effect and migration, are related to technique and product selection rather than the treatment itself. At Nexus Clinic KL, tear trough filler follows strict assessment criteria, product selection guidelines and cannula technique to minimise these risks." },
    { q: "How much filler is needed for the tear trough?", a: "Most patients need 0.3 to 0.8ml per side for natural-looking correction. This is one of the lowest-volume areas on the face and should stay that way. More than 1ml per side in a single tear trough session is rarely clinically appropriate and increases the risk of puffiness, Tyndall effect and migration." },
    { q: "Can tear trough filler be dissolved?", a: "Yes. HA tear trough filler is fully dissolvable with hyaluronidase. If you develop the Tyndall effect, puffiness, migration or are simply unhappy with the result, the filler can be partially or completely removed. This reversibility is particularly important in the under-eye area given the high visibility of complications. At Nexus Clinic KL, hyaluronidase is available at every filler appointment." },
    { q: "Should I get cheek filler or tear trough filler first?", a: "For many patients, cheek filler should come first. When the cheek has descended and is contributing to tear trough depth, filling the tear trough without addressing the midface support produces a less natural, less long-lasting result. The doctor assesses the relationship between your cheek position and tear trough depth at consultation and advises the optimal sequence." },
    { q: "How do I know if I am a suitable candidate for tear trough filler?", a: "The clearest sign that you are a suitable candidate is that your under-eye concern looks like a hollow groove or dark shadow rather than a puffy swelling. If you look tired but your under-eye is more sunken than puffy, filler is likely appropriate. If you have significant puffiness or eye bag fat protrusion, filler is not the right treatment. A proper clinical assessment at consultation confirms candidacy definitively." },
    { q: "What is the Tyndall effect and how is it prevented?", a: "The Tyndall effect is a bluish discolouration that occurs when filler is placed too superficially under the very thin under-eye skin. The HA gel scatters light through the skin surface and creates a visible blue tint. It is the most common complication of incorrectly performed tear trough filler. It is prevented by deep placement on the periosteum using a low-hygroscopic soft product via cannula technique. If it occurs, it is treated with hyaluronidase." },

The under-eye skin produces more melanin in response to UV exposure and even gentle eye rubbing. This brown pigmentation is independent of the structural tear trough and does not respond to filler injections. Patients in Malaysia often have both pigmentation and structural hollowing at the same time, which requires a combined approach.</p>

Nasal congestion from allergies causes venous congestion around the eyes, darkening the under-eye skin from dilated blood vessels. This creates what is clinically called allergic shiners, a blue-purple discolouration that is present even in young patients. Filler does not address this vascular component. Managing the underlying allergy and using skin booster treatment to improve skin quality are the appropriate approaches for the vascular element.</p>

                    <p className="text-taupe font-inter text-sm">As discussed in detail on the Nexus Clinic KL cheek filler page, Asian patients experience midface volume loss earlier than Western patients. As the cheek descends, it pulls support away from the lower eyelid and makes the tear trough deepen more rapidly. This is why tear trough hollowing in Malaysian patients often appears in the late twenties rather than the mid-thirties.</p>

              <p className="text-taupe font-inter text-sm mb-4">
                  This is one of the most important clinical considerations in under-eye rejuvenation and one that most patients are never told before booking tear trough filler.
              </p>
              <p className="text-taupe font-inter text-sm mb-4">
               The tear trough deepens in part because the cheek below it has descended. When the cheek drops, the lid-cheek junction widens, the support for the lower eyelid disappears and the tear trough hollow deepens from below. In these cases, adding tear trough filler alone fills the hollow but does not address the structural reason the hollow formed. The result lasts less time than it should, requires more frequent top-ups and is less natural-looking than it would be with proper midface foundation first.
               <br/> The American Society of Plastic Surgeons has noted that successful tear trough rejuvenation frequently requires addressing the midface simultaneously to provide a stable structural foundation, since the under-eye area is highly dependent on the support provided by the cheek below it.
              </p>
              <div className="bg-wine/5 p-3 rounded-lg">
                <p className="text-brown font-inter text-xs">
                  At Nexus Clinic KL, the doctor assesses the relationship between your cheek position and your tear trough depth at consultation. Patients who need cheek support first are given a staged treatment recommendation, not simply sold tear trough filler regardless of their anatomy.

                Risk of the Tyndall Effect
              </h3>
              <p className="text-taupe font-inter text-sm mb-3">
                If filler is placed too superficially, it can create a bluish tint visible through the skin. 
                This is prevented by deep placement with correct product and reversed with hyaluronidase if it occurs.
