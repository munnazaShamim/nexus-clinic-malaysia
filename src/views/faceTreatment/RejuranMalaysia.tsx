                What Is Rejuran and <span className="text-wine italic">How It Works</span>
              </h2>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                Rejuran is best understood as a skin-healing and regenerative injectable, not a standard filler. It contains 
                polynucleotides that are described in clinic and brochure materials as supporting the skin's self-repair processes, 
                restoring extracellular matrix support and encouraging collagen-related improvement in damaged or ageing skin.
              </p>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                That difference matters. A filler creates shape or direct volume. Rejuran is chosen when the bigger problem is 
                poor skin condition. The goal is not mainly to make the face larger or sharper. The goal is to help the skin 
                become smoother, stronger, more elastic and healthier-looking over time.
              </p>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                This is one reason Rejuran has become popular for people who feel their skin quality has declined even when 
                they do not actually need filler. Acne-scarred skin, pore-prone skin, fragile under-eye tissue and early ageing 
                skin are all concerns where regenerative improvement can matter more than added volume.

                  Clinical evidence supports the role of polynucleotides in tissue repair and skin regeneration. A study by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10763787/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" className="text-wine font-bold italic hover:underline">Sini P, Denti A, Cattarini G, et al.</a> demonstrated that polynucleotides promote tissue repair, stimulate fibroblast activity, and support collagen-related skin regeneration, supporting their use in treatments such as Rejuran for improving skin texture, elasticity, and overall skin recovery.

For patients with active breakouts contributing to ongoing scarring, combining Rejuran with <Link href="/skin/acne-treatment-malaysia/" className="text-wine font-bold italic">acne treatment in Malaysia</Link> can address both active lesions and existing textural damage.

              Rejuran is better positioned for people who want the skin itself to behave better and look healthier over time. 
              That distinction is strongly reflected in the way clinics and brochures describe it as a skin healer or regenerative 
              injectable rather than a contouring product.
            </p>

            <p className="text-center text-brown mt-4">
              Unlike dermal fillers that add volume or basic skin boosters that provide only hydration, Rejuran focuses on deep skin regeneration and collagen support. Patients with fragile under-eye skin or vascular dark circles may find additional benefit from <Link href="/face/skin-booster-malaysia/" className="text-wine font-bold italic">skin booster in Malaysia</Link> to complement Rejuran's healing effects. Those with deeper acne scars requiring structural correction can explore <Link href="/skin/acne-scar-treatment-malaysia/" className="text-wine font-bold italic">acne scar treatment in Malaysia</Link> for more aggressive resurfacing alongside Rejuran maintenance.
