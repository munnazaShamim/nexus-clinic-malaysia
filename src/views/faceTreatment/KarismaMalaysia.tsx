    { q: "Is Karisma suitable for everyone?", a: "Suitability should be decided after a medical consultation, especially because different skin concerns may be better treated with filler, skin boosters, collagen stimulators or other procedures." },

                Official product information says Karisma FACE Rh Collagen promotes production of type I collagen in fibroblasts

A comprehensive review by Wang Y, et al. explains that collagen-based biomaterials promote fibroblast activity, support tissue regeneration, and improve skin structure and elasticity due to their excellent biocompatibility and natural distribution in tissues.

              Unlike hyaluronic acid fillers that create immediate volume or basic skin boosters that add only hydration, Karisma focuses on collagen restoration for long-term skin quality improvement. Patients with fragile under-eye skin or hollowing may find better results by pairing Karisma with <Link href="/face/under-eye-filler-malaysia/" className="text-wine font-bold italic">under eye filler in Malaysia</Link> for structural support. Those seeking overall skin brightness and maintenance can complement Karisma with regular <Link href="/skin/hydrafacial-malaysia/" className="text-wine font-bold italic">HydraFacial in Malaysia</Link> sessions for surface-level glow.

                Many clinics now offer Karisma in Malaysia, but the product alone is not the whole treatment. The result still 
                depends on assessment, injection technique and whether the patient's concern is actually skin quality, collagen 
                loss or something else.

              Karisma is typically recommended as a 2-session course spaced 1 month apart, with maintenance every 6 to 9 months depending on skin condition. Patients with age-related collagen loss affecting facial volume may achieve deeper structural improvement by combining Karisma with <Link href="/face/sculptra-malaysia/" className="text-wine font-bold italic">Sculptra in Malaysia</Link> for gradual collagen stimulation. Those concerned with fine lines and skin laxity on the neck and décolletage can also explore <Link href="/face/profhilo-malaysia/" className="text-wine font-bold italic">Profhilo in Malaysia</Link> as a complementary bio-remodelling treatment for overall skin hydration and firmness.
