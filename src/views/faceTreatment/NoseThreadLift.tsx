    { q: "How long does a nose thread lift last in Malaysia?", a: "PDO nose threads last 12 to 18 months. PLLA threads last 18 to 24 months. PCL threads last 24 to 36 months. The collagen produced during the thread dissolving process extends the visible result beyond the thread lifespan in most patients. Many PCL patients report maintained definition two to three years after their treatment." },
    { q: "How much does a nose thread lift cost in Malaysia in 2026?", a: "Nose thread lift treatments at Nexus Clinic KL typically range from RM 1,400 to RM 2,500 depending on whether the treatment involves tip refinement or bridge enhancement. Combined nose bridge and tip treatments usually range from RM 2,500 to RM 3,500 based on the number of threads used and the level of correction required. Final pricing is confirmed during consultation." },
    { q: "Is a nose thread lift painful?", a: "The most noticeable discomfort is the local anaesthetic injection at the nasal tip entry point, which resolves within seconds. Once the area is numb, the thread insertion using a blunt cannula is generally described as mild pressure rather than pain. Most patients rate the overall experience as very manageable. The full procedure takes 15 to 20 minutes." },
    { q: "What is the difference between nose thread lift and nose filler?", a: "Nose thread lift inserts dissolvable threads that lift and reposition tissue structurally. It is best for bridge height, tip definition and improving the side profile. Nose filler adds volume using hyaluronic acid gel to raise the bridge or smooth a dorsal hump. Filler carries a slightly higher vascular risk in the nasal area. Threads carry no vascular risk. Many patients achieve the best result by combining both at Nexus Clinic KL." },
    { q: "How many sessions of nose thread lift are needed?", a: "Most patients achieve their desired result in a single session. Some patients choose to return for a second session 12 to 18 months later when PDO threads begin to dissolve, either to maintain the result or to upgrade to PCL threads for a longer-lasting outcome. Patients who start with PDO often progress to PCL at the second session once they are satisfied with how the treatment looks and feels." },
    { q: "Can a nose thread lift fix a crooked nose?", a: "Mild nasal asymmetry or crookedness can often be improved with strategic thread placement. The doctor assesses the degree and structural origin of the asymmetry at consultation. Mild deviation caused by tissue asymmetry rather than cartilage or bone displacement responds better to thread correction. Significant structural asymmetry, particularly bone-related crookedness, typically requires surgical assessment." },
    { q: "Is a nose thread lift safe in Malaysia?", a: "Nose thread lift is significantly safer than nose filler in terms of vascular risk. There is no blood supply involvement during thread insertion as a blunt cannula is used rather than a sharp needle. The thread materials, PDO, PLLA and PCL, have been used in surgical sutures for decades. At Nexus Clinic KL, only MDA-registered White Medience threads from a Korean GMP-certified manufacturer are used." },
    { q: "Can a nose thread lift be reversed?", a: "No. Unlike HA filler which is fully dissolvable, nose threads cannot be removed once placed. However, they dissolve naturally over time, so any result you do not like will resolve on its own. This is why the doctor assesses candidacy carefully and first-time patients are often recommended to start with PDO threads, which dissolve within 12 to 18 months." },
    { q: "What results can realistically be expected from nose thread lift?", a: "A nose thread lift produces visible bridge elevation, improved tip definition and a cleaner side profile. The degree of change is proportional to the starting anatomy and thread count used. It does not produce the same dramatic projection as surgical rhinoplasty and is not intended to. The goal is natural, harmonious improvement within the existing structure of your nose." },
    { q: "Who is not suitable for a nose thread lift?", a: "Nose thread lift is not recommended for patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, have an active skin infection near the nose, have very thin nasal skin that increases extrusion risk, have had recent rhinoplasty, or have significant structural nasal deformity requiring surgical correction. Patients with keloid scarring tendencies should discuss this with the doctor at consultation." },

                Asian Nose Anatomy and Why <span className="text-wine">So Many Malaysians Seek Nose Enhancement</span>
              </h2>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                Among East and Southeast Asian populations, including the majority of patients in Malaysia, 
                the nasal structure is genetically different from the proportions that Western cosmetic standards were originally built around.
              </p>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                The Asian nose typically has a lower, flatter nasal bridge with less bony projection. 
                The nasal tip is often broader and less defined, with thicker skin covering the cartilage below. 
                The columella, the strip of tissue between the nostrils, tends to sit lower.
              </p>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                Nose thread lift was developed in Korea specifically to address this anatomical pattern. 
                The HIKO technique, named from the Korean words meaning high nose, was designed around Asian nasal proportions 
                and relies on thread placement that provides vertical structural support from within the nasal bridge.

              <p className="text-taupe font-inter mb-4">
                When threads are inserted along the nasal bridge or into the nasal tip using a blunt cannula, 
                they create a physical scaffold beneath the skin. The threads are anchored at the nasal tip and run upward along the bridge, 
                pulling tissue slightly tighter and lifting the structure above them.
              </p>
              <p className="text-taupe font-inter">
                The nose is visibly higher and more defined from the moment the procedure is complete. 
                This effect is structural, not volumetric. The threads do not add bulk. They reposition and support existing tissue.

              <p className="text-taupe font-inter mb-4">
                As the threads begin to dissolve, the body responds to the biocompatible material by producing new collagen around each thread's length. 
                This collagen framework reinforces the structural improvement achieved in phase one.
              </p>
              <p className="text-taupe font-inter">
                By the time the threads have fully dissolved, a natural collagen scaffold has formed in their place. 
                Patients typically notice the best improvement between six and twelve weeks after treatment.

            The most complete non-surgical nose result is often achieved by combining nose thread lift with a small amount of nose filler. The threads provide structural lift and tip definition while filler addresses bridge height and any remaining volume deficit. Your doctor will assess which approach or combination best addresses your nasal profile at consultation, including options for lifting effect.
