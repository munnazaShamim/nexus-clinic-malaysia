  const faqData = [
    { q: "How long does nose filler last in Malaysia?", a: "Nose filler in Malaysia typically lasts 12 to 18 months depending on the product used and the patient's individual metabolism. The nose is a relatively high-mobility area compared to the cheeks but lower than the lips. Most patients schedule a maintenance top-up between 12 and 15 months after their initial treatment. Combining nose filler with nose thread lift often extends the overall result because the threads provide structural support that reduces filler breakdown rate." },
    { q: "How much does nose filler cost in Malaysia in 2026?", a: "Nose filler treatments in Malaysia typically range from RM 1,800 to RM 3,000+ at Nexus Clinic KL in 2026, depending on the product used, volume required and the level of correction needed. Final pricing is confirmed after consultation based on your facial structure and treatment plan." },
    { q: "Is nose filler safe in Malaysia?", a: "Nose filler is safe when performed by a licensed medical doctor trained in nasal vascular anatomy, using MOH-approved HA products, with hyaluronidase available for emergency use. The nose is the highest-risk filler area on the face due to its proximity to the ophthalmic circulation. The treatment is significantly more dangerous when performed by unregistered practitioners, in non-clinical settings or with cheap unregistered products. At Nexus Clinic KL, all nose filler treatments follow strict vascular safety protocols." },
    { q: "Can nose filler be dissolved if I do not like the result?", a: "Yes. Hyaluronic acid nose filler is fully dissolvable with hyaluronidase. If you are unhappy with the shape, volume or symmetry of the result, the filler can be partially or completely removed at a follow-up appointment. This is one of the primary reasons HA filler is the standard choice for non-surgical rhinoplasty. Permanent fillers and non-HA products used for the nose cannot be dissolved and carry significantly higher complication risk." },
    { q: "How much filler is appropriate for the nose?", a: "Most nose filler treatments use 0.5 to 1ml for natural, proportionate results. Volume above 1.5ml in a single nose session increases compression risk to nasal vasculature and the risk of skin necrosis from pressure on blood vessels. If a clinic recommends more than 1.5ml of nose filler in a single session without strong clinical justification, this warrants a careful second opinion. The nose responds well to precise, conservative volumes placed at the right depth." },
    { q: "What is the difference between nose filler and a non-surgical nose thread lift?", a: "Nose filler adds volume using hyaluronic acid gel to raise the bridge, smooth a hump or refine the tip. The result is immediate and the treatment is reversible. Nose thread lift inserts dissolvable PDO or PCL threads that lift and reposition existing nasal tissue without adding volume. Threads carry a significantly lower vascular risk than filler because no injection of a foreign substance into blood vessel proximity is involved. Many patients get the best overall result by combining both at the same appointment." },
    { q: "Can I have nose filler after rhinoplasty?", a: "Yes, but with important precautions. Post-rhinoplasty nose filler can address minor contour irregularities, depressions or asymmetries in healed surgical noses. The altered vascular anatomy after rhinoplasty increases the complication risk slightly compared to a non-operated nose. The doctor needs to assess the surgical history, scarring pattern and skin thickness carefully before planning treatment. A minimum of 12 months post-surgery healing is required before filler can be safely considered." },
    { q: "Will nose filler make my nose look bigger?", a: "Correctly placed nose filler creates the visual impression of a more defined, narrower nose, not a larger one. Adding height to a flat bridge draws the nose upward rather than outward and creates the proportional definition that makes the nose look narrower in context. The most common cause of an overfilled, wider-looking nose is too much volume placed at too superficial a depth, especially around the bridge or tip. Correct technique with the right volume should produce the opposite visual effect." },
    { q: "How painful is nose filler?", a: "Most patients describe the nose filler experience as manageable pressure rather than significant pain. Topical numbing cream is applied before treatment and most HA products used at Nexus Clinic KL contain built-in lidocaine. The injection itself takes 15 to 20 minutes. The bridge area is generally comfortable. The columella and tip areas are slightly more sensitive but still well tolerated." },
    { q: "Who is not suitable for nose filler?", a: "Nose filler is not suitable for patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, have an active skin infection in the nasal area, have previously had rhinoplasty within the last 12 months, have a known allergy to HA or lidocaine, have an autoimmune condition affecting healing, or have had previous permanent filler placed in the nose that has not been fully removed. Patients with severe structural deformity or significant dorsal humps are better served by surgical rhinoplasty." },

                The radix zone at the nasal root between the eyes carries the highest risk of serious vascular complication due to its proximity to the vessels supplying the ophthalmic circulation. At Nexus Clinic KL, this zone is approached with extreme caution and only injected when clinically indicated with strict volume control.
                
                Patients who want nose reshaping with a lower vascular risk profile often consider <Link  href='/face/nose-thread-lift-malaysia/' className='font-bold text-wine italic'>nose thread lift </Link>as an alternative or complementary treatment at Nexus Clinic KL.

              { title: "Low Nasal Bridge", desc: "The most common nose filler request in Malaysia. A flat bridge with minimal height and projection makes the face look broader and the nose less defined. Small volumes of firm HA filler placed along the dorsum create immediate height and projection. This is the most predictable and straightforward nose filler application with a high satisfaction rate when technique and volume are correct." },
              { title: "Dorsal Hump Camouflage", desc: "A dorsal hump is a bony or cartilaginous prominence visible as a bump on the nose profile. Filler cannot remove the hump but can be placed above and below it to create a straight or slightly concave profile line. This optical correction is effective for mild to moderate humps. Very large humps reduce the safe available injection volume for the non-surgical nose job and may be better addressed surgically. The doctor assesses this at consultation." },
              { title: "Drooping Nasal Tip", desc: "A tip that points downward or droops at rest makes the nose look longer and older. Small amounts of filler placed at the columella or tip can lift the projection angle slightly and create a cleaner nasal tip appearance. This is a technically demanding zone due to the columellar vasculature and is performed with very precise, very small volume injections." },
              { title: "Mild Nasal Asymmetry", desc: "Natural asymmetry in the nose, whether from development, previous injury or post-surgical irregularity, can often be improved with selective filler placement on the deficient side. The doctor maps the asymmetry at consultation and confirms a realistic degree of correction achievable with filler before proceeding." },
              { title: "Post-Rhinoplasty Refinement", desc: "Patients who have had surgical rhinoplasty sometimes develop contour irregularities, small depressions or minor asymmetries as the surgical outcome matures. Filler can address these secondary concerns in healed post-rhinoplasty noses, providing a refined look without surgery. This is a specialist application requiring careful assessment of the changed vascular anatomy in the post-surgical nose." },
