    { q: "What is Plinest treatment?", a: "Plinest is a polynucleotide-based injectable treatment within Mastelli's aesthetic medicine range, commonly positioned for skin regeneration, hydration, elasticity and overall skin quality improvement." },
    { q: "Is Plinest a filler?", a: "Not in the usual contouring sense. Plinest is generally positioned more as a regenerative skin treatment than a classic volumising filler. It focuses more on tissue support and skin quality than on reshaping facial features." },
    { q: "How much does Plinest cost in Malaysia?", a: "Public clinic examples in Malaysia place Plinest around RM 1,800 to RM 2,500 per syringe or session, with broader market listings ranging roughly from RM 1,500 to RM 3,500 per session depending on the clinic and treatment area." },
    { q: "How many Plinest sessions do I need?", a: "Protocols vary. Mastelli's ageing-skin fact sheet describes 4 sessions every 1 to 2 weeks, while clinic guidance often uses 3 to 4 sessions spaced 2 to 3 weeks apart." },
    { q: "When will I see Plinest results?", a: "Visible improvement usually develops gradually rather than instantly. Clinic education sources describe improvements building over about 2 to 8 weeks, with more noticeable results after a full course." },
    { q: "What does Plinest help with?", a: "Plinest is commonly used for fine lines, dullness, dehydration, reduced elasticity, rough texture, enlarged pores, acne scars and fragile under-eye skin quality." },
    { q: "Is Plinest good for acne scars?", a: "Published review and clinic sources suggest polynucleotides, including Plinest-based treatments, are used for acne scars and textural improvement in appropriate patients." },
    { q: "Is there downtime after Plinest?", a: "Downtime is usually limited, but mild swelling, redness, tenderness or bruising may happen temporarily after injections." },
    { q: "How long does Plinest last?", a: "Plinest is often done as a course, followed by maintenance, with some clinic guidance mentioning maintenance at around 6 to 9 months." },
    { q: "Is Plinest the same as Profhilo or Nucleofill?", a: "No. They are different injectable categories and formulations. Plinest is positioned around polynucleotide-based regeneration, while other products are framed differently depending on their composition and intended effect." },
    { q: "Who is suitable for Plinest?", a: "Plinest is generally more suitable for patients whose main concern is skin quality, fine lines, dehydration, early ageing, reduced elasticity or textural damage, rather than those wanting major contour changes. Final suitability should always be decided after consultation." },

                What Is Plinest and <span className="text-wine italic">How It Works</span>
              </h2>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                Plinest is generally positioned as a polynucleotide regenerative treatment rather than a standard dermal filler. 
                In simple terms, it is used to support better-quality skin by helping the tissue recover, hydrate and function 
                more effectively.
              </p>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                Polynucleotides are commonly described in the literature as regenerative molecules that support fibroblast activity, 
                tissue repair and the skin environment. The 2024 review focused on Asian skin regeneration reports that ageing and 
                dry skin, big pores, skin laxity and acne scars were among the main treatment indications.
              </p>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                Plinest is therefore best understood as a treatment for skin quality. It is not mainly about changing the shape 
                of your face. It is more about helping the skin look stronger, smoother, fresher and more elastic over time.

                  Clinical evidence supports the role of polynucleotides in skin regeneration. A 2024 review by <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11311621/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" className="text-wine font-bold italic hover:underline">Lee KWA, Kim JH, Park KY, et al.</a> demonstrates that polynucleotides improve skin texture, enhance elasticity, support fibroblast activity, and promote tissue regeneration, supporting their use in treatments such as Plinest for improving overall skin quality and facial rejuvenation.

              Plinest uses polynucleotides to support skin hydration, elasticity, and tissue repair for a smoother, healthier complexion. For patients with active acne contributing to textural damage, combining Plinest with <Link href="/skin/acne-treatment-malaysia/" className="text-wine font-bold italic">acne treatment in Malaysia</Link> can address both breakouts and healing. Those with post-inflammatory marks may also benefit from <Link href="/skin/pigmentation-treatment-malaysia/" className="text-wine font-bold italic">pigmentation treatment in Malaysia</Link> to achieve an even skin tone while Plinest rebuilds skin quality.

              Unlike dermal fillers that add volume or basic skin boosters that provide only hydration, Plinest focuses on deep polynucleotide regeneration for lasting skin improvement. Patients with fragile under-eye skin or dark circles may find additional benefit from <Link href="/face/under-eye-filler-malaysia/" className="text-wine font-bold italic">under eye filler in Malaysia</Link> to address structural hollowing alongside Plinest. Those seeking overall skin health maintenance can pair Plinest with <Link href="/skin/hydrafacial-malaysia/" className="text-wine font-bold italic">HydraFacial in Malaysia</Link> for surface-level glow and hydration between sessions.

              Plinest is typically priced as a course of 3 to 4 sessions, with final cost depending on treatment area and product quantity required. Patients with age-related collagen loss affecting facial structure may achieve better long-term results by combining Plinest with <Link href="/face/sculptra-malaysia/" className="text-wine font-bold italic">Sculptra in Malaysia</Link> for deeper collagen stimulation. Those concerned about fine lines and skin laxity on the neck and décolletage can also explore <Link href="/face/profhilo-malaysia/" className="text-wine font-bold italic">Profhilo in Malaysia</Link> as a complementary bio-remodelling treatment.
