    { q: "Is NEWEST a filler?", a: "Not in the usual contouring sense. NEWEST is better positioned as a regenerative and hydrating skin-quality treatment rather than a product used mainly for shaping lips, cheeks, chin or jawline." },
    { q: "What is the difference between NEWEST and Plinest?", a: "Malaysia clinic sources commonly present both as Mastelli polynucleotide treatments, but NEWEST is frequently described as having an added hydration-focused element through hyaluronic acid, while Plinest is positioned more around pure regenerative repair." },
    { q: "How many NEWEST sessions do I need?", a: "A Malaysia clinic summary lists NEWEST as commonly done in 3 to 4 sessions, though the exact plan depends on the area treated and your skin condition." },
    { q: "How long do NEWEST results last?", a: "One Malaysia clinic source describes results lasting up to 12 months, but actual duration depends on the treatment course, maintenance plan and patient factors." },
    { q: "What does NEWEST help with?", a: "NEWEST is commonly positioned for hydration, elasticity, radiance, skin quality, collagen support, regeneration and ageing-prone fragile skin areas." },
    { q: "Is NEWEST good for under-eyes and neck?", a: "Malaysia clinic sources do list under-eyes, neck, hands and décolleté among the commonly treated areas, but final suitability should always be assessed by the doctor." },
    { q: "Is there downtime after NEWEST?", a: "Downtime is generally expected to be low, though mild temporary redness, swelling, tenderness or small bumps can happen after injection." },
    { q: "Is NEWEST the same as Rejuran or Profhilo?", a: "No. They are different injectable categories and formulations, even though they may overlap in the broader skin-rejuvenation space." },
    { q: "Who is suitable for NEWEST?", a: "NEWEST is generally more suitable for patients whose main concern is poor hydration, dullness, reduced elasticity, early skin ageing or weaker skin quality rather than major contour change. Final suitability should always be confirmed during consultation." },

                What Is NEWEST and <span className="text-wine italic">How It Works</span>
              </h2>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                NEWEST is best understood as a polynucleotide-based skin rejuvenation injectable designed to improve overall 
                skin health rather than simply add direct volume. Malaysia clinic sources repeatedly describe it as a PN-HPT 
                treatment that helps restore skin rigidity, elasticity and radiance by improving skin health from within.
              </p>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                What makes NEWEST stand out from basic hydration injectables is that it is often described as combining the 
                regenerative role of polynucleotides with the moisturising and plumping effect of hyaluronic acid. This 
                combination supports deep hydration, tissue repair, firmer texture and better elasticity.
              </p>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                In practical terms, this means NEWEST is usually chosen when the skin itself looks like the problem. The 
                patient may not need bigger cheeks or a sharper jawline. Instead, the skin may need better hydration, 
                stronger support, smoother texture and improved resilience.
