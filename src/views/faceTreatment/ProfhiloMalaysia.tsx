    { q: "How long does Profhilo last?", a: "Results commonly last around 6 to 9 months, though this varies from person to person." },
    { q: "Is Profhilo the same as filler?", a: "No. Profhilo is mainly used to improve skin quality, hydration and firmness. Filler is used to add volume and shape." },

    { q: "When will I see results from Profhilo?", a: "Some patients notice better hydration and glow first. Firmer, smoother improvement usually builds over the next few weeks." },
    { q: "What age is best for Profhilo?", a: "There is no single best age. It is often chosen by adults who notice dullness, fine lines, dehydration or early skin laxity and want a natural improvement." },
    { q: "Can Profhilo lift sagging skin?", a: "Profhilo can improve skin quality and mild laxity, but it does not replace a true lifting treatment when sagging is more advanced." },
    { q: "Is there downtime after Profhilo?", a: "Downtime is usually minimal. Small bumps, redness or mild bruising can happen, but these are usually temporary." },
    { q: "Who is not suitable for Profhilo?", a: "Suitability should be decided by a doctor. In general, injectable treatments may be postponed or avoided in people with active skin infection, certain medical issues, pregnancy, or other factors that need assessment first." },

                What Is Profhilo and <span className="text-wine italic">How It Works</span>
              </h2>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                Profhilo is an injectable skin remodelling treatment made with high-purity hyaluronic acid. Unlike dermal filler, 
                it is not used to build cheeks, shape the chin or add volume to the lips. Instead, it spreads through the tissue 
                to improve hydration and support better skin quality.
              </p>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                It is often described as a bio-remodelling treatment because the goal is not to fill a line, but to improve the 
                condition of the skin itself. Patients usually choose Profhilo when they feel their skin has become thin, tired, 
                loose or less fresh than before.
              </p>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                One of the reasons Profhilo became so popular is that it treats skin quality in a very natural-looking way. 
                Skin still looks like your skin, just healthier, more hydrated and more refined.

            Unlike dermal fillers that add direct volume, Profhilo works by spreading beneath the skin to boost hydration and stimulate collagen remodelling. Patients with age-related collagen loss causing flattened cheeks or softened jawlines may achieve better structural support by combining Profhilo with <Link href="https://www.nexus-clinic.com/face/sculptra-malaysia/" className="text-wine font-bold italic">Sculptra in Malaysia</Link>, which rebuilds facial volume gradually over months. For those seeking overall skin health maintenance, our <Link href="https://www.nexus-clinic.com" className="text-wine font-bold italic">aesthetic clinic in Kuala Lumpur</Link> offers comprehensive doctor-led treatment planning.

                Profhilo is typically priced as a 2-session course, with final cost depending on treatment area and product authenticity. Patients with persistent facial redness or sensitivity may first require barrier repair, which can be assessed through our <Link href="/skin/rosacea-treatment-malaysia/" className="text-wine font-bold italic">rosacea treatment in Malaysia</Link> options.
