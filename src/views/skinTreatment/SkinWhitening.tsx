  const faqData = [
    { q: "Can skin whitening treatment permanently change my natural skin colour?", a: "No ethical clinic in Malaysia should claim permanent skin colour change. Clinical skin whitening treatments address pigmentation, which is the excess melanin deposited in the skin from UV damage, hormonal triggers, inflammation and post-acne marks. Treating this pigmentation brightens and evens the skin significantly, but your natural baseline skin tone determined by your genetics remains unchanged. The distinction matters because treatments that genuinely work do so by clearing acquired pigmentation rather than by removing the melanin your skin produces naturally for UV protection. At Nexus Clinic KL, the goal of every whitening programme is to restore your skin to its natural brightest, clearest baseline, not to alter your genetic skin colour." },
    { q: "How many sessions of glutathione IV drip do I need to see results?", a: "Visible skin brightening from glutathione IV drip typically requires 6 to 12 weekly sessions before meaningful change is apparent. The mechanism is gradual systemic suppression of melanin production, which means results develop progressively rather than appearing suddenly. Most patients notice an improvement in overall skin radiance and reduction in dullness from sessions 4 to 6, with more significant tone brightening becoming apparent by session 8 to 10. Maintenance sessions once or twice monthly after the initial course sustain the results. Patients expecting dramatic whitening in two or three sessions are likely responding to overclaims they have encountered from other sources; the physiological mechanism of glutathione simply does not work at that speed." },
    { q: "Are glutathione IV drips safe?", a: "Glutathione IV drips are safe when prescribed and administered by licensed doctors using pharmaceutical-grade glutathione in a clinical setting. The risks associated with IV glutathione in Malaysia arise almost entirely from unregulated settings where the product quality, sterility of equipment, glutathione concentration and administration protocol are not medically supervised. Complications including infection from non-sterile needles, embolism from improperly administered IV lines and contamination from substandard product formulations are all preventable risks that do not occur in properly managed clinical environments. At Nexus Clinic KL, all IV drip treatments are administered by qualified clinical staff under doctor supervision using pharmaceutical-grade, MOH-registered formulations." },
    { q: "Is Pico Laser safe for dark skin tones common in Malaysia?", a: "Yes, with the correct wavelength selection. The 1064nm wavelength is specifically suited for Fitzpatrick Types III to V because it penetrates below the melanin-rich epidermis rather than being absorbed at the surface, minimising the risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. At Nexus Clinic KL, our doctors use conservative energy settings on initial sessions and adjust depending on individual skin response, following a protocol developed for Malaysian skin phototypes. Patients with Fitzpatrick Type IV or V skin who have been told at previous clinics that laser is not safe for them should understand that this is only true if the wrong wavelength or excessive energy settings are used; it is not an inherent property of Pico Laser technology." },
    { q: "What causes skin to darken in body areas like underarms and knees?", a: "Body area darkening is caused by post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from repeated friction and minor trauma to the skin. The underarms darken primarily from friction during arm movement, irritation from shaving or waxing, and chemical irritation from deodorant ingredients. The knees and elbows darken from constant pressure and friction on the skin during normal daily movement. The inner thighs darken from walking friction, heat and sweat in the tropical Malaysian climate and, in some cases, hormonal influences. These body areas have thicker skin than the face and accumulate PIH more readily because the mechanical forces acting on them are continuous. Treating them requires the same medical-grade approaches used for facial pigmentation, applied with settings adjusted for thicker body skin." },
    { q: "What ingredients should I avoid in whitening products in Malaysia?", a: "Mercury and high-concentration unregistered hydroquinone are the two most dangerous ingredients found in unregistered whitening products circulating in Malaysia. Mercury is a heavy metal neurotoxin and nephrotoxin that accumulates in the body with chronic skin exposure and can cause irreversible kidney damage, neurological effects, and systemic toxicity. Hydroquinone, when used in unregulated concentrations without medical supervision, causes ochronosis, a permanent bluish-black skin discolouration, and rebound hyperpigmentation that is darker than the original condition when use is discontinued. Under MOH Malaysia regulations, mercury is prohibited in all cosmetic products and hydroquinone requires prescription and medical oversight. Any whitening product purchased online or from non-medical sources that promises rapid dramatic whitening should be assessed by a pharmacist or doctor before use." },
    { q: "Can I combine Pico Laser with glutathione IV drip?", a: "Yes. This is in fact one of the most effective combinations for comprehensive skin brightening at Nexus Clinic KL. Pico Laser addresses existing melanin deposits at the surface and mid-dermal level through targeted photoacoustic fragmentation. Glutathione IV drip suppresses new melanin production systemically, reducing the rate at which new pigmentation forms after the laser clears the existing deposits. Together, the combination tackles both the clearance of existing pigmentation and the prevention of new pigmentation in a complementary mechanism. Sessions are typically scheduled on the same day or within a few days of each other. There are no contraindications between the two modalities, making them safe and effective for patients seeking aesthetic improvements." },
    { q: "How is skin whitening different from skin brightening?", a: "In clinical practice, skin whitening and skin brightening describe the same category of treatment, which is the reduction of melanin-based discolouration and the restoration of a clearer, more even-toned skin appearance. The term whitening is more commonly used in the Malaysian and Southeast Asian consumer market, while brightening is more commonly used in Western clinical contexts. At Nexus Clinic KL, both terms refer to the same clinical goal: reducing acquired pigmentation caused by UV damage, hormonal triggers, PIH and dullness to restore the skin to its natural baseline brightness. Neither term implies a permanent change in genetic skin colour, and any provider using either term to imply a permanent two or three shade skin tone change is making a clinically unsupportable claim." },
    { q: "Is skin whitening treatment suitable for men?", a: "Yes. Skin whitening concerns among male patients in Malaysia are common and clinically identical to those in female patients. Male patients frequently present with UV-induced darkening from outdoor work or sports, PIH from post-acne marks, uneven neck pigmentation from sun exposure during outdoor activities, and body area darkening. The treatment approach is the same across genders; the specific modality and protocol are determined by the skin concern and Fitzpatrick type, not by gender. Male patients at Nexus Clinic KL benefit from the same comprehensive whitening programme framework, including Pico Laser, IV glutathione drip and medical-grade brightening topicals as applicable to their specific presentation." },
    { q: "Is the skin whitening consultation at Nexus Clinic KL free?", a: "Yes. Your initial skin whitening consultation at Nexus Clinic KL is complimentary and includes a full skin assessment and Fitzpatrick classification, identification of your specific whitening concern and its cause, matching of your goal to the appropriate treatment or combination programme, complete and transparent pricing before any treatment is booked, realistic outcome expectations and an honest discussion of what the recommended treatments will and will not achieve. If a treatment you have heard about is not appropriate for your skin concern or carries risks that outweigh its benefits for your specific situation, our doctors will tell you clearly." },
