  const faqData = [
    { q: "What is the difference between Signature, Deluxe and Platinum HydraFacial?", a: "Signature HydraFacial is the core three-step session covering cleanse, extract, and hydrate using patented vortex-fusion technology with Antiox+ serum. It takes 30 to 40 minutes and is ideal for maintenance and general brightness. Deluxe HydraFacial adds a targeted booster serum for your specific skin concern, such as Britenol for pigmentation, Rozatrol for sensitive skin, or DermaBuilder for fine lines, plus LED light therapy. It takes 45 to 60 minutes. Platinum HydraFacial adds lymphatic drainage massage before the core steps for maximum depuffing, detoxification and sculpting. It takes 60 to 75 minutes and is the choice for special occasions or patients wanting the most comprehensive single-session experience." },
    { q: "How often should I get a HydraFacial in Malaysia?", a: "Monthly HydraFacial sessions produce the best sustained results for most patients. Monthly frequency aligns with the skin's natural cell turnover cycle of approximately 28 days, meaning each session works with freshly renewed surface cells rather than clearing the same accumulated congestion from an overly long interval. For patients with active acne or heavy congestion, fortnightly sessions for the first 6 to 8 weeks followed by monthly maintenance is sometimes recommended. For patients using HydraFacial purely for occasional glow maintenance or event preparation, sessions every 4 to 8 weeks are appropriate." },
    { q: "Is HydraFacial suitable for sensitive and rosacea-prone skin?", a: "Yes. HydraFacial is one of the most suitable professional facial treatments for sensitive and rosacea-prone skin precisely because it uses suction-based extraction rather than manual pressing, delivers serums rather than high-concentration acids at ablative doses, and has no heat delivery that triggers vascular flushing. At Nexus Clinic KL, sensitive and rosacea patients are treated with the Signature tier or Deluxe with the Rozatrol booster at reduced suction settings. LED red light therapy is particularly beneficial for rosacea as it reduces vascular reactivity and supports barrier repair. Patients with a rosacea diagnosis are always assessed by a doctor before their first session." },
    { q: "Can HydraFacial be combined with other treatments?", a: "Yes, and combination pairing is frequently recommended at Nexus Clinic KL. HydraFacial pairs particularly well with Pico Laser for pigmentation management, with the HydraFacial session typically performed 7 to 14 days before or after a Pico Laser session to maintain skin hydration and surface clarity without interfering with the laser's healing phase. It also pairs well with skin booster injections, which can be performed on the same day as HydraFacial since HydraFacial is non-invasive and does not create skin trauma that would contraindicate injection. HydraFacial is not typically combined on the same day as RF Microneedling or fractional laser due to the heat and micro-injury involved." },
    { q: "How long do HydraFacial results last?", a: "The immediate post-treatment glow, smoothness and hydration from a single HydraFacial session are typically visible for 5 to 7 days in normal conditions, and up to 2 weeks in patients who follow the aftercare guidance and maintain daily SPF50 use. With monthly sessions, the cumulative improvement in baseline skin health, pore size and hydration persists increasingly well between sessions as the skin barrier strengthens. Patients who discontinue monthly sessions will find their skin gradually returns to its pre-programme baseline over 4 to 8 weeks, as no permanent structural change to the skin is made by HydraFacial; it is a surface and serum-based treatment that requires ongoing maintenance for sustained results." },
    { q: "Is HydraFacial suitable for men?", a: "Yes. HydraFacial is equally effective and appropriate for men, and is one of the most popular no-downtime skin treatments among male patients at Nexus Clinic KL. Men commonly seek HydraFacial for post-shaving congestion and sensitivity, enlarged pores and oiliness, dullness from daily sun and pollution exposure, and as a no-fuss monthly skin maintenance treatment that requires no recovery period. The treatment protocol and tier selection for male patients follows the same skin-concern-driven approach as for female patients, with no clinically meaningful difference in how the treatment performs across genders." },
    { q: "What is the difference between HydraFacial and a regular facial?", a: "A traditional facial relies on manual techniques, where the depth of cleansing, the pressure of extractions and the penetration of applied serums vary with each therapist and each session. HydraFacial uses a medical-grade device with a patented tip that delivers consistent vortex suction pressure for extraction and simultaneously infuses serum into the open pore. This device-driven consistency produces more uniform, reproducible results than manual facials and achieves deeper serum penetration due to the simultaneous extraction-infusion mechanic. HydraFacial also uses clinical-grade serum formulations that are not available in over-the-counter skincare." },
    { q: "Can HydraFacial help with acne scars?", a: "HydraFacial improves the surface skin quality, hydration and texture that surrounds acne scars and can reduce the visibility of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation with the Britenol booster. However, it does not structurally remodel depressed acne scar tissue, as it works at the surface and shallow pore level rather than the mid-to-deep dermis where scar tissue forms. For patients with pitted or atrophic acne scars requiring structural improvement, HydraFacial works best as a complementary monthly maintenance treatment alongside deeper clinical interventions." },
    { q: "How much does HydraFacial cost in Malaysia?", a: "At Nexus Clinic KL, Signature HydraFacial is priced from RM 380 to RM 520, Deluxe from RM 520 to RM 720 and Platinum from RM 720 to RM 950 per session. Monthly packages for 4 sessions start from RM 1,500 for Signature and RM 2,000 for Deluxe, representing a meaningful saving compared to individual session pricing. Booster add-ons to Signature sessions are priced at RM 80 to RM 150. All pricing is confirmed before treatment and includes the pre-treatment skin consultation, the full device session and post-treatment SPF application. No additional charges arise after the session." },
    { q: "Is the HydraFacial consultation at Nexus Clinic KL free?", a: "Yes. Your first skin consultation at Nexus Clinic KL before a HydraFacial session is complimentary. It includes a skin type and concern assessment, a recommendation of the most appropriate tier and booster for your skin, a discussion of how HydraFacial fits within your broader skin health goals if you are managing pigmentation, acne or ageing concerns, and full session pricing transparency. Honest consultations are standard at Nexus Clinic KL. If your primary skin concern is better addressed by a different treatment modality before or alongside HydraFacial, our doctors will tell you clearly." },
