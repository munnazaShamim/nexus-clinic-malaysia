  const faqData = [
    { q: "How many sessions do I need for laser hair removal?", a: "Most people need multiple sessions. The AAD notes 2-6 treatments for many patients, while Nexus Clinic protocols plan 6-8 sessions for optimal results. Face areas may require 8-12 sessions due to slower hair cycles. Sessions are spaced 4-6 weeks apart for body areas and 6-8 weeks for facial hair." },
    { q: "Is laser hair removal permanent?", a: "Laser hair removal provides long-lasting hair reduction, not total permanent removal for every follicle. Most patients achieve 80-90% permanent hair reduction after a full course. Regrowth is usually finer and lighter. Maintenance sessions may be needed every 12-24 months, especially for hormonally driven areas like the female chin." },
    { q: "Does laser hair removal hurt?", a: "Most people describe the sensation as warm pinpricks or a rubber band snap. The Nd:YAG laser with integrated cryogen cooling significantly reduces discomfort. Numbing gel may be used for sensitive areas like the bikini line and face. Most patients rate discomfort at 2 to 4 out of 10." },
    { q: "Can laser hair removal work on dark skin in Malaysia?", a: "Yes, with the right laser technology. The 1064nm Nd:YAG laser is specifically designed for darker skin tones (Fitzpatrick IV to VI) because it bypasses the melanin-rich epidermis. Published studies confirm Nd:YAG is safe for Fitzpatrick IV to VI skin tones. At Nexus Clinic KL, this is the primary laser used for Malaysian patients." },
    { q: "What should I avoid before my laser session?", a: "Avoid waxing, threading, or plucking for at least 4 weeks before treatment as these remove the root that the laser targets. Avoid sun exposure and tanning for 2-4 weeks before. Shave the area 1-2 days before your session. Avoid using fake tan products. Inform your doctor about any photosensitizing medications." },
    { q: "Can I shave between sessions?", a: "Yes. Shaving is recommended between sessions because it keeps the follicle intact while removing surface hair. Never wax, thread, or pluck between sessions as this removes the hair root that the laser needs to target. Shaving is permitted at any time between your scheduled appointments." },
    { q: "How soon will I see results?", a: "The AAD notes many people see a 10-25% reduction after the first treatment. Underarms often show visible reduction from session 2 to 3. Legs and larger areas show meaningful results from session 3 to 4. Maximum results are assessed after completing the full 6-8 session course plus 3-6 months of collagen remodelling." },
    { q: "What are the side effects?", a: "Common short-term side effects include redness and mild swelling lasting a few hours to 48 hours. Pigment changes can occur but are rare with correct wavelength selection. Blistering or scarring is very rare when performed by qualified doctors. Paradoxical hair growth (increased hair in treated areas) is rare but documented, especially on darker skin." },
    { q: "Why is my hair growing back after laser?", a: "Hair grows in cycles. Only hairs in the active anagen phase are effectively treated. New hair appearing between sessions is hair that was in telogen or catagen during the previous session, now entering its next anagen phase. This is not treatment failure—it is why multiple sessions are needed." },
    { q: "How much does laser hair removal cost in Kuala Lumpur?", a: "Cost varies by area size, number of sessions, technology used, and clinic location. At Nexus Clinic KL, upper lip starts from RM150-280 per session, underarms RM300-500, bikini RM350-600, full legs RM900-1,600. Package pricing for 6-8 session programmes is available and reduces per-session cost." },
    { q: "Is IPL the same as laser hair removal?", a: "No. IPL uses broad-spectrum light while laser uses a single precise wavelength. Laser is more precise, more effective per session, and safer for darker skin tones. IPL carries higher PIH risk for Malaysian Fitzpatrick III-V skin. Professional laser hair removal is the gold standard for permanent hair reduction." },
    { q: "Should I do laser hair removal at a salon or a medical clinic?", a: "The AAD and Mayo Clinic both caution that complications like burns and pigment changes are more likely in inexperienced hands. Medical supervision matters. Under Malaysia's Private Healthcare Facilities and Services Act, medical aesthetic laser procedures must be performed by LCP-certified doctors. Salon IPL operates in a regulatory grey area." },
