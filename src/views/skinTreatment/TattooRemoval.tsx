    { step: "Blister and Scab Management", why: "Blistering is a common and expected response; improper blister management is the most common cause of scar formation", instruction: "Do not puncture blisters; allow them to resolve naturally over 3 to 5 days; do not pick scabs; scabs should fall off naturally over 7 to 14 days" },
    { step: "SPF50 Sunscreen (Critical for Malaysian Skin)", why: "Malaysia's year-round UV index of 10 to 13 represents a continuous risk; UV exposure on healing skin stimulates melanocytes causing changes in skin pigmentation", instruction: "SPF50 broad-spectrum mineral sunscreen mandatory from the morning after every session throughout the entire treatment course and for 3 months after the final session" },
    { step: "Session Spacing and Skin Healing", why: "Each session triggers a multi-week process of ink clearance; skin needs 6 to 8 weeks between sessions for adequate healing", instruction: "Sessions spaced minimum 6 weeks apart for body tattoos and 8 weeks apart for facial tattoos; progress assessed photographically at each visit" },

  const faqData = [
    { q: "How does laser tattoo removal work?", a: "Laser tattoo removal works by directing a concentrated beam of laser light into the layers of skin where the tattoo ink particles sit in the dermis. The laser targets the ink particles using selective absorption: different wavelengths of laser light are absorbed by different colours of tattoo ink. When the laser energy is absorbed by the ink particles, the picosecond laser pulses create a photoacoustic (pressure-based) effect that shatters the ink particles into microscopic dust. These tiny ink particles are then cleared by the body's lymphatic system over the following 6 to 8 weeks. This is why sessions for complete removal are spaced 6 to 8 weeks apart rather than done in rapid succession." },
    { q: "Is laser tattoo removal painful?", a: "Most patients describe the sensation of laser tattoo removal as a rubber band snapping against the skin with each laser pulse. The pico laser delivers its pulses extremely rapidly, which means the treatment is over quickly despite the snapping sensation. At Nexus Clinic KL, numbing cream is applied 30 to 45 minutes before every laser tattoo removal session to significantly reduce discomfort. During the session, a cooling device blows cold air onto the area being treated immediately around each laser pulse, both for comfort and to protect the surrounding skin. Tattoos on bony areas (such as the ankle, wrist or collarbone) tend to be more sensitive than tattoos on fleshy areas." },
    { q: "How many sessions does tattoo removal require?", a: "The number of sessions depends on six factors assessed at the initial consultation using the Kirby-Desai framework: the Fitzpatrick skin type, the tattoo size, the tattoo age, the complexity of the tattoo in terms of ink colours, the location of the tattoo on the body and whether it is a cover-up layered tattoo. Small amateur black ink tattoos may clear in 3 to 5 pico laser sessions. Professional black and dark blue tattoos typically require 6 to 9 sessions. Multi-colour tattoos with green, red or yellow ink require 8 to 14 or more sessions. Cover-up tattoos with multiple layers of ink require the most sessions." },
    { q: "Can tattoo removal leave a scar?", a: "When laser tattoo removal is performed correctly using the appropriate laser technology at the right settings for the skin type, with proper session spacing and followed by the correct post-laser skin care, the risk of scar formation is very low. The most common causes of scar formation in tattoo removal in Malaysia are: incorrect laser settings for the skin type producing excess heat; compressed session intervals that do not allow adequate skin healing; improper post-session care including picking scabs or blisters; and poor hygiene allowing infection of the treated area. At Nexus Clinic KL, all of these scar risk factors are addressed through proper skin type assessment, appropriate session spacing, detailed aftercare instructions and a prescribed skin care programme." },
    { q: "What is the difference between pico laser and Q-switch laser for tattoo removal?", a: "Pico laser (picosecond laser technology) delivers picosecond laser pulses in trillionths of a second, which is 100 times faster than Q-switched nanosecond laser pulses. This speed advantage means pico laser breaks down ink particles into much smaller fragments per laser pulse compared to Q-switch, allowing the lymphatic system to clear the ink faster and reducing the number of sessions for complete removal. Pico laser also works primarily through a pressure-based photoacoustic effect rather than a heat-based photothermal effect, which significantly reduces the risk of changes in skin pigmentation in darker Malaysian skin tones. At Nexus Clinic KL, pico laser is the primary laser tattoo removal treatment for most patients, with Q-switch used selectively for specific situations." },
    { q: "Does skin type affect laser tattoo removal?", a: "Yes, significantly. Malaysian patients with Fitzpatrick III to V skin tones have melanin throughout the epidermis that competes with tattoo ink for laser energy absorption. This means the laser cannot be applied at as high an energy level per session on darker skin tones without risking changes in skin pigmentation from epidermal melanin activation. Advanced pico laser technology is the preferred type of tattoo removal laser for darker Malaysian skin because its pressure-based mechanism bypasses much of this epidermal melanin competition and targets the deeper ink particles more selectively. Q-switch laser carries a higher risk of changes in skin pigmentation on darker skin tones and requires more conservative settings, which in turn requires more sessions." },
    { q: "Can all tattoo colours be removed completely?", a: "Not all tattoo colours respond equally to laser tattoo removal treatment. Black and dark blue ink are the easiest colours to remove completely and typically achieve complete removal within the estimated session range. Green and teal ink require specific laser wavelengths and respond more slowly, with complete removal achievable in most cases with the advanced pico laser system. Red and orange ink responds well to 532nm laser wavelength when correctly matched. Yellow tattoo ink is the most challenging colour and requires the yellow laser, a specific wavelength not available in all laser systems; complete removal of dense yellow ink may not be achievable even with advanced pico laser technology. At Nexus Clinic KL, patients with yellow ink in their tattoo are counselled honestly that this colour requires the most sessions and that realistic expectations must be set." },
    { q: "Is laser tattoo removal safe for Malaysian skin?", a: "Laser tattoo removal is safe for Malaysian skin when performed with the appropriate laser technology at settings calibrated for the patient's specific skin type. The advanced pico laser technology used at Nexus Clinic KL is specifically advantageous for Malaysian Fitzpatrick III to V skin because its photoacoustic mechanism minimises the heat deposited in the surrounding skin and epidermal melanin layer, significantly reducing the risk of changes in skin pigmentation and scar formation. The most important safety factors for tattoo removal in Malaysia are: using an advanced pico laser system specifically designed for darker skin tones; proper Fitzpatrick skin type assessment before each session; mandatory SPF50 application throughout the treatment course; and adequate session spacing of 6 to 8 weeks to allow complete skin healing." },
    { q: "How much does tattoo removal cost in Malaysia in 2026?", a: "The cost of tattoo removal in Malaysia at Nexus Clinic KL is calculated based on the tattoo size, the type of tattoo ink colours present and the laser technology required. Small tattoos up to 5cm range from RM 400 to RM 800 per session for pico laser. Medium tattoos 5 to 15cm range from RM 800 to RM 1,500 per session. Large tattoos over 15cm range from RM 1,500 to RM 2,500 per session. Programme pricing for a combination laser tattoo removal course across 6 sessions provides a meaningful per-session reduction. All pricing is disclosed at the free initial consultation before any removal session is booked." },
    { q: "Can I remove a cosmetic tattoo like eyebrow or lip liner?", a: "Yes. Permanent makeup removal including microblading, eyebrow tattoos, eyeliner and lip liner is a common reason people seek laser tattoo removal. Cosmetic tattoos often use specialised inks that may respond differently to laser treatment than body art inks. The same colour-specific wavelength principles apply: black and brown cosmetic inks respond well, while lighter cosmetic inks may require specific wavelengths. At Nexus Clinic KL, cosmetic tattoo removal is assessed individually and the expected outcome is discussed before treatment begins." },

              Accurate session prediction requires assessing skin type, tattoo age, ink colours, and body location. Patients with darker Fitzpatrick skin (Types III to V) need conservative laser settings to minimise PIH risk, which extends treatment duration. For those also managing <Link href="https://www.nexus-clinic.com/skin/acne-scar-treatment-malaysia/" className="text-wine font-bold italic">acne scar treatment in Malaysia</Link>, similar principles of skin protection and collagen preservation apply.

              For Malaysian patients with Fitzpatrick skin types III to V, pico laser offers a safer and more effective alternative to Q-switched technology due to its photoacoustic mechanism and lower PIH risk. Those with hormonal or vascular pigmentation concerns can explore <Link href="/skin/melasma-treatment-malaysia/" className="text-wine font-bold italic">melasma treatment in Malaysia</Link> for targeted management.

            <p className="text-taupe font-inter text-sm mt-1">
              Malaysia's year-round UV index of 10 to 13 means that skin undergoing tattoo removal is continuously exposed to UV that drives changes in skin pigmentation. A patient who attends every removal session but does not apply SPF50 between sessions significantly increases the risk of persistent post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. At Nexus Clinic KL, SPF50 is prescribed as a mandatory component of the tattoo removal programme.

              Laser tattoo removal in Malaysia is safe, effective and more predictable than ever with advanced pico laser technology. The key to the best outcome is correct wavelength selection for each ink colour, honest session count expectations, appropriate laser settings for your skin type, and complete aftercare.
            </p>
            <p className="text-cream/90 font-inter">
              Whether you are removing a small tattoo or working through a complex multi-colour cover-up tattoo, the treatment plan at Nexus Clinic KL is built around your specific tattoo, not a generic protocol. Our licensed doctors bring over 15 years of combined clinical experience and have completed over 5,000 procedures.
