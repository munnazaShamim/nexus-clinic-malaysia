  const faqData = [
    {
      q: "How many sessions of fractional CO2 laser are needed for acne scars?",
      a: "Most patients require 3 to 5 sessions of Fractional CO2 laser, spaced 4 to 6 weeks apart, depending on scar depth and treatment goals. Your doctor at Nexus Clinic KL will assess your specific scarring and provide a personalised session estimate at your consultation.",
    },
    {
      q: "How long does it take to see results after acne scar treatment?",
      a: "Initial improvement can be noticed within 2 to 4 weeks, but the most dramatic visible changes typically occur between 3 and 6 months as new collagen matures. Collagen remodelling is a slow biological process, which is why patience and completing the full protocol are essential for optimal results.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is laser acne scar treatment safe for darker skin tones (Malaysian skin)?",
      a: "Yes, when performed by a licensed doctor experienced with Fitzpatrick skin types III to V. At Nexus Clinic KL, we use conservative energy settings on first sessions, incorporate non-ablative modalities like Pico Laser and RF Microneedling, and prescribe structured post-treatment sun protection to minimise the risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Aggressive settings designed for lighter skin can trigger darkening on Asian skin, which is why our protocols are specifically calibrated for Malaysian patients.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is the difference between Pico Laser and Fractional CO2 for acne scars?",
      a: "Pico Laser targets surface and mid-dermal concerns using photoacoustic pressure without significant surface ablation. It excels at post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, early shallow scars, and improving skin tone with minimal downtime. Fractional CO2 Laser performs ablative resurfacing, creating controlled micro-wounds that trigger deep collagen remodelling and physically alter scar morphology. It is more effective for moderate to deep atrophic scarring but involves 5 to 7 days of recovery. Many patients benefit from both technologies in sequence.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is subcision and what scars is it for?",
      a: "Subcision is a minor surgical procedure performed under local anaesthetic where a specialised bevelled needle is inserted beneath a rolling or tethered scar. The needle is swept in a fanning motion to physically sever the fibrous bands anchoring the scar floor to deeper tissue. Once released, the depressed skin rises naturally and the created space fills with new collagen over weeks. Subcision is a prerequisite for true rolling scar correction and is often overlooked by patients who have tried laser alone without result.",
    },
    {
      q: "How much does acne scar treatment cost in Malaysia in 2026?",
      a: "Pricing varies by scar severity, treatment type, and number of sessions. At Nexus Clinic KL in 2026, Pico Laser ranges from RM 700 to RM 1,200 per session, Fractional CO2 Laser from RM 1,200 to RM 2,500 per session, RF Microneedling from RM 1,000 to RM 1,800 per session, and Subcision from RM 500 to RM 900 per session. Combination scar programmes start from RM 3,500 for 4 to 6 sessions across multiple modalities. Final pricing is confirmed after your scar mapping consultation.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can acne scars be fully removed?",
      a: "Clinically meaningful and visible improvement, typically a 50 to 80 percent reduction in scar depth and pigmentation, is achievable for most scar types with a properly designed combination programme. Complete removal to a level indistinguishable from unaffected skin is not always possible, particularly for deep ice pick scars or longstanding hypertrophic scars. What patients consistently achieve is a significant improvement in skin texture and tone that makes scars far less visible in natural lighting and reduces dependence on heavy-coverage makeup.",
    },
    {
      q: "How many subcision sessions do I need?",
      a: "Most patients require 1 to 3 subcision sessions, depending on the severity and number of tethered rolling scars. The procedure takes 30 to 60 minutes, and improvement builds gradually over 2 to 3 months as new collagen fills the space created by releasing the scar tissue.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I treat acne scars if I still have active breakouts?",
      a: "Our doctors recommend waiting until active acne is either resolved or well-controlled before beginning aggressive scar treatment. Active inflammation can worsen scar formation and compromise healing after laser or needling procedures. A period of 3 to 6 months of acne stability is generally preferred before beginning fractional resurfacing. For patients with active acne alongside established scarring, our doctors will assess whether simultaneous management is feasible or if treating active acne first produces the best outcome.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is the difference between fractional laser and non-fractional laser?",
      a: "Fractional laser treats the skin in fractions, leaving healthy tissue between treated micro-zones. This supports faster healing and reduces side effect risk compared to older non-fractional approaches that treated the entire surface at once. Fractional CO2 and fractional Pico lasers are the modern standards for acne scar treatment because they balance efficacy with manageable downtime.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is a realistic acne scar improvement goal?",
      a: "The most realistic goal is visible improvement in texture and depth that makes scars less noticeable in everyday lighting and reduces reliance on makeup. Most patients do not need 'perfect' skin; they want smoother skin in real lighting. Combination plans using 2 to 3 modalities tailored to your specific scar types deliver the best outcomes, and your doctor at Nexus Clinic KL will provide an honest expectation at your consultation.",
    },
    {
      q: "What aftercare is required after acne scar treatment?",
      a: "Aftercare is critical for protecting your results. For the first 48 hours, keep the skin gentle, avoid heat, saunas, and heavy workouts. For the first week, apply SPF50 daily even indoors, pause harsh actives like retinoids and strong acids, and keep skin hydrated. Between sessions, do not rush; your skin needs time to rebuild collagen. Full aftercare guidance is provided in writing at Nexus Clinic KL.",

                Why Malaysian Skin Needs Specialised Care
              </h3>
              <p className="text-taupe font-inter text-sm mb-4">
                Malaysian skin sits predominantly in Fitzpatrick types III to V.
                Darker skin types carry a significantly higher risk of
                post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation after laser and needle-based
                procedures. Aggressive ablative laser settings that deliver
                excellent results on lighter Caucasian skin can trigger
                darkening, prolonged redness or uneven healing when applied
                without adjustment to Asian skin.

                Humidity and Healing Factors
              </h3>
              <p className="text-taupe font-inter text-sm">
                Malaysia's tropical humidity affects healing. The moist
                environment can support faster superficial recovery, but it also
                increases the risk of bacterial contamination on open or
                sensitized post-laser skin. Our post-treatment protocols account
                for this with clear, evidence-based wound care guidance that
                reflects the local climate rather than instructions written for
                patients in cooler or drier countries.

              In real practice, many patients benefit from blending these modalities. Rolling scars often need subcision first, then resurfacing. Boxcar scars respond well to <Link href="/skin/pico-laser-malaysia/" className="text-wine font-bold italic">laser</Link> or microneedling. Mixed scarring requires a combination approach.

              Collagen remodelling is a slow biological process. Most patients
              notice the most dramatic visible changes between months 3 and 6 as
              the new collagen matrix matures. Planning a realistic timeline
              before beginning protects patients from disappointment.

              Acne scars respond to treatment. The texture your skin has today
              is not the texture it has to keep. What changes outcomes is the
              precision of the approach: matching the right treatment to the
              right scar type, calibrating every session to your skin's specific
              response, and committing to a realistic programme.
