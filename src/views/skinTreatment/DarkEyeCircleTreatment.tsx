  const faqData = [
    { q: "Why do I have dark circles even when I sleep well?", a: "Adequate sleep is only one of the common causes of dark circles under the eyes. The other four are structural volume loss creating a shadow, genetic or UV-driven pigmentation, blood vessel visibility through thinning skin and allergic rhinitis causing venous congestion around the sinuses. Patients with structural, pigmented, vascular or allergy-driven dark circles will not see significant improvement from sleep alone regardless of how many hours they rest. The persistence of dark circles despite good sleep and adequate hydration is the primary indicator that a clinical assessment is warranted to identify the actual cause before any treatment is selected." },
    { q: "What is the most effective treatment for dark circles in Malaysia?", a: "There is no single most effective treatment because the correct treatment depends entirely on the type of dark circle. Tear trough filler is the most effective treatment for structural hollowing-related shadows, producing immediate improvement visible from the day of injection. Pico Laser is most effective for pigmented periorbital hyperpigmentation. Sylfirm X and Rejuran I are most effective for vascular circles. The most common presentation in Malaysian patients over 30 is mixed, involving both structural and pigmented components, requiring a sequenced combination of filler followed by laser or Rejuran I for optimal outcome." },
    { q: "Is tear trough filler safe?", a: "Tear trough filler is safe when performed by an experienced doctor using appropriate technique and correct product selection. The under-eye area is the highest-risk filler zone on the face because of its thin skin and proximity to the orbital septum and infraorbital vessels. At Nexus Clinic KL, tear trough filler is performed exclusively by licensed aesthetic doctors, using a cannula technique in most cases to reduce bruising and vascular risk, with low-viscosity hyaluronic acid products specifically formulated for this zone. Hyaluronidase enzyme is available to dissolve filler immediately if any complication arises." },
    { q: "How long does tear trough filler last?", a: "Tear trough filler placed in the deep periosteal plane typically lasts 12 to 18 months in most patients. Results duration varies based on the patient's metabolic rate, the specific product used and the volume placed. Some patients retain visible results for up to 24 months. When the filler gradually resorbs, the hollow shadow slowly returns over weeks to months rather than disappearing suddenly. Top-up treatments at 12 to 18 months maintain continuous improvement. At Nexus Clinic KL, the product and volume selected produce natural results that age gracefully rather than creating an overfilled appearance." },
    { q: "Can dark eye circles be permanently removed?", a: "Permanent removal depends on the type of dark circle. Structural circles caused by volume loss return as ageing continues, as the tear trough deepens progressively over years even with regular filler maintenance. Pigmented circles can be cleared significantly with Pico Laser and maintained with SPF50 use and quarterly toning sessions, but may recur with UV exposure or hormonal changes. Vascular circles can be reduced with Sylfirm X and dermal thickening with Rejuran I but may require periodic maintenance as periorbital skin continues to thin with age. Allergy-driven circles will persist as long as underlying allergic rhinitis is active." },
    { q: "What is Rejuran I and how is it different from regular skin booster?", a: "Rejuran I is a polynucleotide formulation specifically engineered for the periorbital zone. Unlike hyaluronic acid skin boosters which provide hydration and volumisation, Rejuran I's PDRN molecules activate fibroblasts to produce new collagen and elastin, physically thickening the under-eye dermis over weeks. This biological thickening effect reduces visibility of underlying blood vessels, making it particularly effective for vascular dark circles. Rejuran I also improves the texture of crepey fine-lined under-eye skin that regular HA skin boosters do not address at the structural level." },
    { q: "Is dark circle treatment suitable for men?", a: "Yes. Dark circles affect men and women equally, and treatment approaches are identical across genders. Male patients at Nexus Clinic KL commonly seek dark circle treatment for professional appearance concerns, with many citing that persistent dark circles make them appear chronically fatigued to colleagues and clients. The diagnostic framework applies equally: structural circles in men respond to tear trough filler, pigmented circles respond to Pico Laser and vascular circles respond to Sylfirm X and Rejuran I. Male patients often respond particularly well to Rejuran I as results are natural-looking rather than obviously treated." },
    { q: "Can I combine dark circle treatment with other facial treatments?", a: "Yes. Dark circle treatment at Nexus Clinic KL is frequently combined with other facial treatments as part of a broader facial rejuvenation plan. Tear trough filler is often performed alongside cheek filler or chin filler, as mid-face volume restoration reduces the apparent depth of the tear trough and may reduce the amount of under-eye filler required. Pico Laser for periorbital pigmentation is commonly performed in the same session as full-face Pico toning for general skin brightening. Rejuran I for the under-eye area can be performed alongside a full-face Rejuran Healer treatment." },
    { q: "How do I know if my dark circles are from allergies?", a: "The key indicators of allergy-driven dark circles include bilateral, symmetrical presentation in the blue-purple tone range, fluctuation in severity that correlates with known allergy triggers such as dust, pollen or pet dander, association with nasal congestion or chronic runny nose, a history of diagnosed allergic rhinitis or hay fever, worsening in the morning compared to the evening, and partial or temporary improvement with antihistamine medication. If you have been using antihistamines and noticed your dark circles lighten, this is a strong indicator of an allergic vascular component." },
    { q: "Is the dark eye circle consultation at Nexus Clinic KL free?", a: "Yes. Your initial dark eye circle consultation at Nexus Clinic KL is complimentary and includes clinical assessment of your dark circle type using the stretch, press and head-tilt tests, confirmation of whether the presentation is pigmented, vascular, structural, allergic or mixed, a recommended combination protocol based on your specific type and anatomy, full transparent pricing before any procedure is booked, and realistic outcome expectations for your specific presentation. If your dark circles are not suitable for a particular treatment due to anatomical or clinical reasons, our doctors will tell you clearly and recommend the appropriate alternative." },

In Southeast Asian markets, there is an increasing shift toward combination non-surgical protocols to address periorbital hollowing and pigmentary concerns in skin types common to the region.
