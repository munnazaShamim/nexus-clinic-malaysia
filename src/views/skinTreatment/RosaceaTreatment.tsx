  const faqData = [
    { q: "Is there a complete cure for rosacea?", a: "There is no complete cure for rosacea. Rosacea is a chronic condition that can be very well controlled with appropriate treatment but typically requires ongoing management rather than a finite treatment course. The goal at Nexus Clinic KL is to achieve a state of maintained remission where flares are infrequent, less intense and more rapidly controlled when they do occur. Many patients achieve excellent long-term control with a combination of daily prescription skincare, trigger management and periodic laser treatment." },
    { q: "Can rosacea affect Malaysian Chinese, Malay or Indian skin?", a: "Yes. Rosacea affects all ethnic skin types including Malaysian patients of Malay, Chinese and Indian ethnicity. Its historical mischaracterisation as a disease of fair-skinned Europeans has created a systematic clinical blind spot that delays diagnosis in Malaysian patients. The symptoms may differ: erythema may be less visually prominent, the papulopustular component may dominate, burning and stinging may precede visible changes, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation may mask underlying redness. If you have persistent central face flushing, bumps that do not respond to acne treatment, or facial skin that reacts strongly to heat, spicy food or skincare products, rosacea should be included in your assessment." },
    { q: "What is the difference between rosacea and acne?", a: "Rosacea and acne can look very similar, particularly papulopustular rosacea. The key differences: rosacea has no comedones (no blackheads or whiteheads); bumps and pustules are distributed centrally on the face rather than appearing on back, chest and jaw; rosacea typically begins in adulthood rather than adolescence; the skin has background persistent redness or flushing. Most importantly, standard acne treatments including retinoids, BHA, benzoyl peroxide and strong exfoliants often worsen rosacea significantly by irritating the compromised barrier." },
    { q: "Which is better for rosacea redness: Sylfirm X or PDL laser?", a: "Both effectively reduce persistent redness and broken capillaries of erythematotelangiectatic rosacea. The key difference for Malaysian patients is skin tone safety. PDL targets haemoglobin through selective photothermolysis, which is highly effective in Fitzpatrick Type III and lighter skin but carries PIH risk in Fitzpatrick Type IV and V skin because competing melanin absorbs laser energy. Sylfirm X uses radiofrequency energy delivered through microneedles, which is colour-blind and safe across all Malaysian skin types. For Fitzpatrick Type IV and V, Sylfirm X is preferred at Nexus Clinic KL." },
    { q: "How long does rosacea treatment take to show results?", a: "Timeline depends on subtype and modality. Topical medications for papulopustular rosacea typically produce visible reduction in papules and pustules within 6 to 8 weeks. Brimonidine can reduce flushing within 30 to 60 minutes of a single application. Oral doxycycline typically produces meaningful improvement at 6 to 8 weeks. Sylfirm X for persistent redness produces progressive improvement over 4 to 8 weeks after each session. Maximum improvement from a 3 to 5 session procedural series is typically assessed at 3 to 4 months after the final session." },
    { q: "Can rosacea be triggered by Malaysian food?", a: "Yes. Several components of traditional Malaysian cuisine are significant triggers. Chilli in its many forms contains capsaicin which activates TRPV1 channels and directly triggers flushing. Black pepper, ginger and other aromatic spices can also trigger responses. Hot beverages including kopi and teh tarik combine heat with other environmental triggers. Complete avoidance is usually impractical. The approach at Nexus Clinic KL is threshold management: identify your individual tolerance level and use practical management measures for unavoidable exposure." },
    { q: "Does rosacea affect the eyes?", a: "Yes. Ocular rosacea affects approximately 50 percent of patients with rosacea and can occur with or without obvious skin manifestations. It produces chronic dry, gritty or burning eyes, frequent styes or eyelid cysts, eyelid redness and scaling, and in severe cases, corneal involvement that can affect vision. At Nexus Clinic KL, ocular rosacea is managed with warm eyelid compresses, preservative-free artificial tears and oral doxycycline or azithromycin for moderate to severe presentations. Any corneal involvement requires ophthalmology referral." },
    { q: "Should I use steroid cream on rosacea?", a: "Usually no. Topical steroids should be avoided on the face for rosacea because they can worsen the condition. While steroids may temporarily suppress inflammation, long-term use on rosacea skin leads to rebound flares, steroid-induced rosacea, and worsening of the underlying condition. At Nexus Clinic KL, steroid creams are not prescribed as a rosacea treatment." },
    { q: "Can I wear makeup with rosacea?", a: "Yes, with the right formulations. Mineral makeup using zinc oxide or titanium dioxide as the pigment base is generally well-tolerated and provides the dual benefit of cosmetic coverage and physical UV protection. Green-tinted colour-correcting products neutralise central face redness effectively. Fragrance-free, non-comedogenic formulations are essential. Waterproof and long-wear formulas should be avoided because they require vigorous removal that disrupts the barrier. All makeup removal should be done with gentle micellar water rather than cleansing balms or wipes requiring rubbing." },
    { q: "Is the rosacea consultation at Nexus Clinic KL free?", a: "The initial rosacea consultation at Nexus Clinic KL is priced at RM 120 to RM 200 and includes clinical skin assessment and Fitzpatrick type classification, rosacea subtype identification using phenotype-directed diagnostic approach adapted for Asian skin, review of previous treatments and their response, written personalised treatment plan covering all prescribed medications and laser recommendations, written rosacea-safe skincare programme calibrated to Malaysia's climate, and written Malaysia-specific trigger management guide. If your presentation is consistent with rosacea that has been mismanaged as acne or eczema, our doctors will explain what was missed and what correct treatment looks like." },

For patients managing facial redness alongside concerns such as <Link href="/skin/acne-treatment-malaysia/" className="text-wine font-bold italic">acne treatment in Malaysia</Link>, distinguishing rosacea from acne is essential for appropriate care.

              Rosacea is undertreated and misdiagnosed in Malaysia. The combination of subtype-specific treatment, phenotype-directed diagnosis adapted for Fitzpatrick III-IV skin, Sylfirm X laser safe across all Malaysian skin types, and practical Malaysia-adapted skincare distinguishes effective rosacea treatment.
            </p>
            <p className="text-cream/90 font-inter">
              Our licensed skin specialist doctors bring over 15 years of combined experience and have completed over 5,000 procedures. We are committed to the diagnostic rigour required to correctly identify rosacea in Asian skin rather than defaulting to an acne or eczema label.
