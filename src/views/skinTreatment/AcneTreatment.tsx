  const faqData = [
    { q: "What is the fastest way to get rid of pimples overnight?", a: "You usually cannot 'cure' a pimple overnight, but you can make it look calmer by morning. Ice can reduce swelling, and spot treatments like benzoyl peroxide can help in some cases. If the pimple is deep and painful, do not squeeze it. That often leads to longer healing and marks." },
    { q: "Can diet affect pimples?", a: "Diet is not the only cause, but some people notice triggers. High-glycemic foods and dairy may trigger breakouts in some people. If you suspect food triggers, keep it simple: track patterns for 2 to 3 weeks, not just one day." },
    { q: "How long does acne treatment take to work?", a: "Most treatments need time. You may notice improvement in about 6 weeks, and many treatments take 2 to 3 months to start working well. Many prescription treatments take 4 to 8 weeks to show results." },
    { q: "Why is my acne getting worse before it gets better?", a: "Some active ingredients (especially retinoids) can cause a temporary flare early on as clogged pores clear. This does not mean the treatment is failing. It means you may need pacing, moisturiser support, and the right frequency." },
    { q: "What is the best treatment for acne?", a: "The 'best' treatment depends on your acne type. Treatment choices are based on severity, including topical combinations and oral antibiotics for more severe cases. For severe or stubborn acne, isotretinoin may be considered under medical supervision." },
    { q: "Does benzoyl peroxide actually work?", a: "It can, especially for mild to moderate acne when used consistently. Benzoyl peroxide attacks acne bacteria and helps unclog pores, and it works best with regular use." },
    { q: "How do I prevent dark marks after acne?", a: "The biggest prevention is reducing inflammation early and not picking. Marks fade faster when breakouts are controlled and sunscreen habits are consistent." },
    { q: "Can I treat acne and sensitive skin at the same time?", a: "Yes, but you need a gentler plan. Start slow, avoid harsh scrubs, and focus on barrier support while introducing actives gradually." },
    { q: "When should I see a doctor for acne?", a: "If acne is painful, leaving marks, recurring, or affecting confidence, do not wait. Many people worry about recurrence and ineffective home remedies, which is often the sign you need a stronger plan." },
    { q: "Is acne laser treatment worth it?", a: "Laser can help certain acne types, especially when inflammation is a major issue, but it is usually best as part of a wider plan. Many KL competitors promote laser options as part of their acne method menu." },
