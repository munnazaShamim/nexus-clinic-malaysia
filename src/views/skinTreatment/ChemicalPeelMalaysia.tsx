    { q: "How much does a chemical peel cost in Malaysia?", a: "Chemical peel prices in Malaysia commonly start from around RM 350 for lighter options, while more advanced medical peels can cost much more depending on strength and clinic." },
    { q: "Is chemical peel good for acne marks?", a: "It can help some acne marks, especially post-inflammatory pigmentation and uneven texture. Suitability depends on the type of marks and your skin type." },
    { q: "How many chemical peel sessions do I need?", a: "Many light peels work best as a series rather than a single treatment, especially for acne, pigmentation and dullness." },
    { q: "Is chemical peel painful?", a: "Most light peels cause stinging, warmth or mild irritation rather than severe pain. Deeper peels are more intense and require more recovery." },
    { q: "How long does it take to recover from a chemical peel?", a: "Recovery depends on depth. Light peels usually involve short-term redness and flaking. Deep peels can cause peeling, crusting, redness and discomfort for days to weeks, with redness sometimes lasting up to three months." },
    { q: "Is chemical peel safe for darker skin?", a: "It can be, but careful selection matters. The AAD specifically notes that people with darker skin tones can develop dark marks or light spots if treatments are not chosen properly." },
    { q: "What is the difference between a light and deep chemical peel?", a: "A light peel treats the outer skin layer and has shorter downtime. A deep peel reaches further, gives stronger resurfacing, and comes with much longer recovery." },
    { q: "Can chemical peel remove pigmentation?", a: "It can improve some types of superficial pigmentation and uneven tone, but results depend on the cause and depth of the pigment." },
    { q: "Who is not suitable for a chemical peel?", a: "Suitability depends on skin type, skin condition, infection risk, active irritation, medical history and pigmentation risk. This should be assessed during consultation." },

                What Is a Chemical Peel and <span className="text-wine italic">How It Works</span>
              </h2>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                A chemical peel is a skin treatment that applies a controlled chemical solution to the skin so the damaged 
                outer layers can shed and renew. As the old skin peels away, the newer skin underneath can look smoother, 
                brighter and more even.
              </p>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                Peels can range from light exfoliating treatments to medium and deep resurfacing procedures, depending on 
                how much correction is needed. That is why chemical peels are used for very different concerns.
              </p>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                A lighter peel may help with clogged pores, dullness and superficial pigmentation. A deeper peel may be 
                considered for more advanced sun damage and more visible texture issues, but it also comes with much more 
                recovery. The key is choosing the right strength for the right skin.

              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                Many clinics offer chemical peels in Kuala Lumpur. The treatment may look simple, but proper assessment 
                matters more than most people think.
              </p>
              <p className="text-brown font-inter">
                The American Academy of Dermatology recommends a consultation before a peel and specifically advises patients 
                to ask whether the doctor has experience performing peels on people with their skin colouring. That matters 
                because darker skin tones can carry a higher risk of unwanted dark marks or light spots.

              Chemical peel pricing varies based on peel depth, skin concern, and number of sessions required. Light peels for acne and dullness are typically more affordable and performed as a series, while medium peels for pigmentation and texture cost more due to stronger formulations and longer recovery monitoring. Patients with deeper acne scars or textural damage may find better value combining peels with <Link href="/skin/acne-scar-treatment-malaysia/" className="text-wine font-bold italic">acne scar treatment in Malaysia</Link> for comprehensive resurfacing. Those seeking ongoing skin brightness after completing their peel series can maintain results with <Link href="/face/skin-booster-malaysia/" className="text-wine font-bold italic">skin booster in Malaysia</Link> to support long-term hydration and collagen health.
