    { name: "Pico Laser", desc: "Delivers ultra-short pulses of laser energy in picoseconds, shattering melanin particles through photoacoustic pressure rather than heat. This significantly reduces the risk of post-laser PIH for Fitzpatrick III to V skin. Effective for sunspots, freckles, PIH and ABNOM. Downtime: mild redness for 24 to 48 hours." },
    { name: "Sylfirm X Radiofrequency Microneedling", desc: "The only device with dual wave radiofrequency technology targeting both abnormal blood vessels and the basement membrane. For melasma patients, this is a significant advantage as it suppresses vascular inflammation and stabilises melanocytes responsible for recurrence." },
    { name: "Dual Yellow Laser", desc: "Combines 577nm yellow and 511nm green wavelengths absorbed by melanin and oxyhaemoglobin. Effective for pigmentation with redness or flushing component, including vascular melasma. Minimal heat transfer makes it safe for sensitive skin." },
    { name: "Medical-Grade Chemical Peels", desc: "Glycolic acid, lactic acid or TCA at medical concentrations accelerate epidermal cell turnover. Most effective for epidermal pigmentation including mild melasma, PIH and general dullness. Prescribed at specific concentrations based on skin type." },
    { name: "Oral Tranexamic Acid Programme", desc: "Prescription medication that blocks the pathway through which UV and hormonal signals trigger melanocyte activation. Particularly effective for melasma. Prescribed as part of a managed programme with monthly reviews." },
    { name: "Skin Booster (Rejuran and Polynucleotide)", desc: "Integrated into pigmentation protocols to support post-laser skin recovery, strengthen the dermal matrix and reduce inflammatory response that can trigger rebound pigmentation." },

  const faqData = [
    { q: "What causes pigmentation on the face?", a: "Pigmentation can come from sun exposure, hormonal changes, genetics, ageing, and skin injury or inflammation. In Malaysia, sun exposure and inflammation from acne or irritation are common triggers. The key is identifying your pigment pattern first, because melasma behaves differently from sunspots or post-acne marks. Once we know the trigger, treatment becomes easier to choose and safer to plan." },
    { q: "Can pigmentation be removed permanently?", a: "Some pigmentation can fade for a long time, but 'permanent' is tricky, especially if the trigger is still present. Many clinics note that relying only on topical products can be limiting, while treatments like laser and chemical peels can improve the chance of longer-lasting results. Maintenance is the difference-maker. Without sun protection and the right homecare, pigment can return." },
    { q: "What is the best treatment for pigmentation in Malaysia?", a: "It depends on the type and depth of pigment. Malaysian clinics commonly discuss options like pico laser, Q-switched laser, IPL, and chemical peels for hyperpigmentation concerns. A plan is 'best' when it improves pigment without triggering rebound or irritation, especially for Asian skin tones. That is why assessment matters before choosing a device." },
    { q: "Is laser treatment safe for melasma?", a: "Laser can be safe when performed by trained doctors using appropriate technology and settings, but melasma needs extra care. Some clinics specifically note that aggressive laser approaches can worsen pigmentation if not used carefully. If your melasma is hormonal and reactive, the plan often includes strict sun protection and maintenance, not only laser sessions." },
    { q: "Can melasma go away on its own?", a: "Melasma may fade slightly over time in some cases, especially if it was triggered by pregnancy, but many people find it persists without treatment. The more sun exposure and heat exposure you get, the more it tends to linger. A proper melasma plan usually focuses on control and long-term management, not a quick 'one time' fix." },
    { q: "Are pigmentation treatments safe?", a: "Most pigmentation treatments are safe when performed by experienced medical professionals using suitable techniques for your skin type. Clinics commonly emphasise tailored treatment selection and appropriate aftercare to reduce unwanted side effects. The biggest risk usually comes from over-treating or mixing too many harsh steps at the same time." },
    { q: "How many sessions will I need for pigmentation removal?", a: "There is no single number. Some people see visible improvement after a few sessions, while deeper or recurring pigment patterns take more time. Many KL clinics mention that multiple sessions are typical for pico laser style pigment programs, often in a multi-session plan depending on severity. Your lifestyle also matters. Sun exposure can slow progress." },
    { q: "How much does pigmentation laser treatment cost in Kuala Lumpur?", a: "Costs vary by clinic, device, and area size. Some KL clinics list laser pigmentation costs around RM500 to RM1,000 depending on sessions and treatment area, while other Malaysia price guides estimate pico laser pigment sessions around RM400 to RM900. Treat these as ranges only. A proper quote depends on your pigment map." },
    { q: "What is the difference between melasma and hyperpigmentation?", a: "Hyperpigmentation is a broad term for darkening of skin. Melasma is a specific type that often appears as patches and is commonly linked with hormonal triggers and sun sensitivity. Many educational resources explain that different pigment conditions need different strategies, and that is why diagnosis matters before treatment." },
    { q: "Is pico laser good for pigmentation?", a: "Many Malaysian clinics describe pico laser as effective for pigment concerns because it uses ultra-short pulses to break down melanin particles, often with minimal downtime when used appropriately. That said, your pigment type still matters. A good outcome comes from matching the right laser approach to your pigment pattern and your skin tone." },

              Melasma sits in both epidermal and dermal layers and is driven by hormonal activity and heat. Applying an aggressive ablative laser without addressing the hormonal trigger and vascular component is the most common reason patients report their melasma worsening.
