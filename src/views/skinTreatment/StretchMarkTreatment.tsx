  const faqData = [
    { q: "Can stretch marks be removed completely?", a: "No cosmetic procedure removes stretch marks completely. Stretch marks are a permanent structural change in the middle layer of the skin caused when the skin has been stretched beyond the capacity of collagen and elastin to compensate. What effective stretch marks treatment achieves is a significant reduction in the appearance of stretch marks: the marks on the skin become flatter, smoother, closer to the surrounding skin tone and far less noticeable. Red or pink stretch marks respond more significantly to laser treatment than white or silver mature marks. At Nexus Clinic KL, we provide honest outcome expectations at the initial consultation specific to the type and stage of stretch marks you have, rather than promising complete removal." },
    { q: "Which treatment is best for stretch marks in Malaysia?", a: "The best stretch marks removal treatment depends on the stage and type of stretch marks. For red active stretch marks (striae rubrae), pulsed dye laser treatment is the most effective first step, targeting the active blood vessels in the middle layer of the skin. For white or silver mature stretch marks (striae albae), fractional CO2 laser treatment is the most effective treatment option for improving skin texture. Microneedling with PRP (platelet rich plasma) is excellent for all stages and is particularly suited to darker Malaysian skin types. RF microneedling is the best advanced treatment for patients who need minimal downtime. A combination of laser treatment and PRP provides the best overall stretch marks removal outcomes." },
    { q: "How many sessions are needed to get rid of stretch marks?", a: "Most patients require 3 to 5 sessions to significantly get rid of stretch marks or reduce their appearance. Red stretch marks may respond visibly from session 2 or 3 with pulsed dye laser treatment. White or silver marks require the full course of fractional laser treatment or RF microneedling with PRP to see meaningful improvement. The exact number of sessions varies based on the severity of the stretch marks, how long they have been present, the body area being treated, and the patient's skin response. At Nexus Clinic KL, a realistic session estimate is provided at the initial consultation and reviewed at each treatment visit based on your progress." },
    { q: "Is stretch mark laser treatment safe for Malaysian skin?", a: "Laser treatment for stretch marks is safe for Malaysian skin types when performed by a qualified LCP certified aesthetic doctor using the correct settings for your Fitzpatrick skin type. The primary risk for Malaysian Fitzpatrick III-V skin is post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), particularly with ablative fractional laser treatment. At Nexus Clinic KL, settings for all laser treatment sessions are calibrated conservatively for Malaysian skin to reduce PIH risk, and SPF50 use is mandatory during the treatment course. RF microneedling and microneedling with PRP carry the lowest PIH risk of the available treatment options and are excellent choices for darker-skinned Malaysian patients." },
    { q: "How much does stretch mark removal cost in Malaysia?", a: "Stretch mark removal cost in Malaysia at Nexus Clinic KL ranges from RM 600 to RM 2,000 per session depending on the laser treatment modality and the body area being treated. A complete treatment programme of 3 to 5 sessions for a single area such as the tummy or thighs costs approximately RM 3,000 to RM 8,000 per area depending on the treatment selected. Combination stretch marks removal programmes incorporating laser treatment and PRP are available at programme pricing. All pricing is disclosed transparently before any commitment at the free initial consultation." },
    { q: "Can stretch mark removal treatment be done during pregnancy?", a: "No. Laser treatment and microneedling with PRP are not recommended during pregnancy. Stretch mark removal treatment in Malaysia should be deferred until after delivery. If breastfeeding, treatment should ideally wait until breastfeeding is complete, though PRP can be considered earlier as it uses the patient's own blood components without any medications. Using stretch mark removal cream during pregnancy to prevent developing stretch marks or reduce their severity is safe and recommended as a preventive measure, particularly on the tummy from the second trimester onwards." },
    { q: "Do stretch marks on the tummy respond to treatment?", a: "Yes. Tummy stretch marks are among the most common presentations at stretch marks removal clinics in Malaysia, particularly in postpartum patients. Tummy stretch marks caused by pregnancy respond well to laser treatment and PRP when treatment begins while the marks are still red or pink. The tummy is a well-accessible treatment area and fractional laser treatment, RF microneedling and PRP are all well-suited to this body area. A course of 3 to 5 sessions is typically recommended for tummy stretch marks at Nexus Clinic KL." },
    { q: "How is Nexus Clinic KL different from other stretch marks removal clinics in Malaysia?", a: "Nexus Clinic KL differentiates from other marks removal clinics in Malaysia in three ways. First, all treatment is performed by a LCP certified aesthetic doctor rather than by therapists or technicians. Second, the treatment plan is stage-matched: red stretch marks receive pulsed dye laser treatment and white or silver marks receive fractional laser or RF microneedling, rather than a single protocol applied regardless of stage. Third, the consultation includes honest outcome expectations including PIH risk for Malaysian skin and realistic improvement percentages rather than overselling complete removal." },
    { q: "Is PRP good for stretch marks?", a: "PRP (platelet rich plasma) is an effective treatment for stretch marks and an important component of the combination advanced treatments programme at Nexus Clinic KL. The platelets and fibrin in PRP contain growth factors that stimulate fibroblast activity, collagen production and skin texture improvement in the treated layer of the skin. PRP combined with microneedling delivers the platelets and fibrin directly into the dermis where stretch marks originate. Published studies show 30 to 40% improvement in the appearance of stretch marks with a full PRP course. PRP treatment is safe for all skin types including darker Malaysian Fitzpatrick skin and carries minimal PIH risk." },
    { q: "Is the stretch mark consultation at Nexus Clinic KL free?", a: "Yes. The initial stretch mark removal consultation at Nexus Clinic KL is complimentary and includes clinical assessment of the type and stage of stretch marks, body area assessment including tummy, thighs, buttock, upper arms and other areas, a review of the cause of stretch marks and any relevant hormonal history, confirmation of the appropriate treatment options available for your specific presentation, an honest outcome expectation discussion, and a personalised cost estimate for the full recommended programme. A LCP certified aesthetic doctor performs the assessment." },
