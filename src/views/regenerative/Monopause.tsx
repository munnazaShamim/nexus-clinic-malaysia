      q: "What is menopausal hormone therapy and who needs it?",
      a: "Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), also called hormone replacement therapy or HRT, replaces the oestrogen and progesterone that decline at menopause; menopause and hrt are closely linked because the symptoms of menopause including hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings, vaginal dryness, sleep disruption and cognitive changes are all consequences of oestrogen withdrawal that hormone replacement therapy directly addresses; menopausal women experiencing significant quality of life impact from menopausal symptoms are the primary candidates for HRT; women with premature menopause or early menopause need menopausal hormone therapy for long-term health protection even if their symptoms are manageable; healthcare professionals at Nexus Clinic KL assess menopausal symptoms, hormone levels and risk profile to determine the most appropriate type of hrt for each individual woman."
    },
    {
      q: "What is the best type of HRT for Malaysian women?",
      a: "For most menopausal women in Malaysia, the best type of hrt is transdermal oestrogen therapy (gel or patch) combined with oral micronised progestogen for women with a uterus; this combined HRT formulation carries the lowest VTE risk, the lowest breast cancer risk among combined regimens, and is the type of hrt specifically recommended in the 2025 PMC narrative review for women with any cardiometabolic or thrombotic risk factors; towards hrt initiation with this formulation is the standard approach at Nexus Clinic KL; oestrogen-only HRT is usually prescribed to women who have had a hysterectomy; healthcare professionals assess each woman's type of hrt choice based on her specific menopausal stage, risk factors and symptom profile."
    },
    {
      q: "Does HRT cause breast cancer?",
      a: "The risk depends entirely on the type of hrt and specifically the type of progestogen used in combined HRT; estrogen alone in hysterectomised women actually reduced breast cancer incidence by 23% in the WHI trial; combined HRT with synthetic progestogen carries a small increased risk; combined HRT with micronised progestogen (oestrogen and progestogen in bioidentical form) carries substantially lower breast cancer risk than oral combined HRT with synthetic progestogen; vaginal oestrogen therapy has negligible breast cancer risk; the formulation-specific potential risks of HRT are communicated to every patient at Nexus Clinic KL before any prescription is issued; menopausal women with a family history of breast cancer receive a detailed individual risk discussion."
    },
    {
      q: "How do I know if I need HRT?",
      a: "Women experience the need for HRT when menopausal symptoms significantly affect quality of life; the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life questionnaire used at Nexus Clinic KL quantifies the severity of menopausal symptoms across vasomotor, psychosocial, physical and sexual domains; if hot flushes are waking you multiple times per night, if mood swings and brain fog are interfering with work, if vaginal dryness is causing pain during intercourse or if joint aches are limiting physical activity, these are meaningful quality of life impacts that hormone replacement therapy can address; women may also need HRT for bone protection if they have premature menopause or early menopause; blood testing confirms perimenopausal or menopausal status by measuring hormone levels and oestrogen levels where the clinical picture is unclear; women experience significant benefit from starting HRT within 10 years of menopause."
    },
    {
      q: "Is there a maximum age or duration for taking HRT?",
      a: "There is no arbitrary maximum age or duration for taking HRT; current guidelines from the British Menopause Society, NICE and the Endocrine Society explicitly state that the decision to continue hrt is based on ongoing individual benefit versus risk at each annual review; hrt and when to initiate a taper or cessation is a decision made between each menopausal woman and her doctor based on her ongoing symptoms, potential risks and overall women's health; menopausal women with severe premature menopause or early menopause may need hormone replacement therapy until the average age of natural menopause at 51 or beyond; menopausal women with persistent menopausal symptoms beyond 5 years may benefit from extended HRT when potential risks are low; at Nexus Clinic KL, each annual review explicitly reassesses whether to continue hrt and whether the ongoing hormone replacement therapy is justified."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I take HRT if my mother had breast cancer?",
      a: "A family history of breast cancer in a first-degree relative is a relative consideration in hormone replacement therapy prescribing, not an absolute contraindication; menopausal women with family history are counselled carefully about their individual breast cancer risk, the type of hrt options and the potential risks and benefits of each formulation; in most menopausal women with family history but no personal history of breast cancer who are experiencing menopausal symptoms, the benefit of appropriately selected transdermal oestrogen therapy with micronised progestogen is considered to outweigh the residual potential risks; healthcare professionals at Nexus Clinic KL discuss all potential risks thoroughly before prescribing any type of hrt; an absolute contraindication is personal history of active oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer."
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if I don't treat menopausal symptoms?",
      a: "Untreated menopausal symptoms significantly affect quality of life for menopausal women affected by hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings, vaginal dryness and sleep disruption; beyond the immediate quality of life impact, the long-term consequences of oestrogen deficiency include accelerated bone loss leading to osteoporosis, increased cardiovascular risk from oestrogen's protective effects on the endothelium, progressive vaginal atrophy producing ongoing vaginal dryness and dyspareunia, and possible increased cognitive decline risk; women experience these long-term consequences most severely when premature menopause or early menopause goes untreated; at Nexus Clinic KL, the reasons for taking HRT are discussed in the context of both immediate menopausal symptom relief and long-term health protection; HRT helps mitigate these effects when prescribed appropriately and monitored regularly."
    },
    {
      q: "Is transdermal HRT better than tablets?",
      a: "For most menopausal women in Malaysia, transdermal oestrogen therapy (gel or patch) is the preferred route because it bypasses first-pass liver metabolism and does not carry the modest VTE risk associated with oral oestrogen therapy; for menopausal women who are obese, who smoke, who have personal or family history of blood clots, who have migraine with aura or who have metabolic risk factors, transdermal hormone therapy is specifically recommended over oral as the safest type of hrt; towards hrt via transdermal delivery is the standard first choice at Nexus Clinic KL; for menopausal women without these risk factors, the absolute risk difference between oral and transdermal is small and individual preference can be accommodated; in Malaysia's climate, gel is generally more practical than patches as patch adhesion can be affected by heat and humidity."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I take HRT during perimenopause when I still have periods?",
      a: "Yes; hormone replacement therapy can be started during perimenopause when menopausal symptoms are present and hormone levels confirm perimenopausal status; during perimenopause, cyclical or sequential combined HRT is prescribed with oestrogen continuously and progestogen added for 12 to 14 days of each cycle to produce a monthly withdrawal bleed; hrt or the combined pill is an option for perimenopausal women who also need contraception; perimenopausal women who are experiencing menopausal symptoms may also benefit from HRT alongside the awareness that fertility is still possible in early perimenopause; healthcare professionals at Nexus Clinic KL assess the most appropriate approach for each perimenopausal woman based on her specific symptom pattern, hormone levels and contraceptive needs."
    },
    {
      q: "Is the HRT consultation at Nexus Clinic KL free?",
      a: "The initial hormone replacement therapy assessment at Nexus Clinic KL is priced at RM 150 to RM 300 and includes a structured menopausal symptom assessment using validated questionnaires, comprehensive medical and family history review including breast cancer and VTE history, blood pressure measurement, physical examination, contraindication screening and blood test requisition for the full pre-HRT hormonal and metabolic panel; a follow-up appointment reviews the blood results and presents the personalised hormone replacement therapy plan with type of hrt recommendation, monitoring schedule and full pricing before any prescription is issued; healthcare professionals at this clinic discuss the potential risks and benefits of using HRT and assist in making an informed decision about taking HRT; menopausal women experiencing menopausal symptoms can book an appointment today at Nexus Clinic KL, located at Wisma UOA II, Jalan Pinang, 50450 Kuala Lumpur, serving patients from across KL, Petaling Jaya, Bangsar, KLCC, Ampang, Mont Kiara and throughout Malaysia."

                  Hot flushes that interrupt every meeting. Night sweats that have not allowed a full night's sleep in six months. Mood swings and a brain that does not feel like your own. These are the menopausal symptoms that many menopausal women in Malaysia accept as an inevitable part of midlife. They are not. These symptoms of menopause include hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings, vaginal dryness, sleep disruption and cognitive changes that are the documented physiological consequences of oestrogen withdrawal at menopause, and hormone replacement therapy is the most effective treatment for them that medical science has produced.

              Hormone replacement therapy in Malaysia has been underused and under-prescribed for more than two decades because of a 2002 study that does not reflect the menopausal women, formulations or menopausal stages that make up actual candidates for HRT in 2026. The menopausal women who are most appropriate for hormone replacement therapy, those experiencing menopausal symptoms under 60 and within 10 years of menopause, are precisely the women who have been most discouraged from seeking it.
