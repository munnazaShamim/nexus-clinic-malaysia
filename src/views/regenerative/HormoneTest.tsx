  // Updated FAQ content
  const faqs = [
    { q: "What is a hormone test and what does it check?", a: "A hormone test is a blood test that measures the levels of specific hormones circulating in the body; a hormonal blood test panel provides a comprehensive hormonal profile that shows whether each hormone is within its normal reference range or is elevated or deficient; the result provides the diagnostic foundation for identifying hormonal imbalances that may be driving symptoms including fatigue, irregular periods, weight gain, low libido, acne, hair loss or mood disturbance; at Nexus Clinic KL, the hormone test is reviewed by a dr at the post-screening consultation to provide clinical interpretation, personalised advice, and a recommendation for treatment or monitoring; a blood test alone without medical interpretation is not a complete health screening service." },
    { q: "Why is hormone screening important for women in Malaysia?", a: "Hormone screening is important for women in Malaysia because hormonal conditions including PCOS, thyroid dysfunction, perimenopause and premature ovarian insufficiency are common, significantly affect quality of life and are highly treatable when identified; many Malaysian women live with fatigue, irregular periods, acne, hair loss or menopausal symptoms for years without their hormonal health being properly assessed; a comprehensive female hormone screening profile including FSH, LH, oestradiol, testosterone and TSH identifies the specific hormonal imbalance driving the health issue and allows a tailored treatment plan to be developed; at this clinic, every female health screening package includes a post-result consultation with a dr who provides specific advice, recommendation and a management solution for identified hormonal findings." },
    { q: "What is included in the female hormonal screening package at Nexus Clinic KL?", a: "The core female hormonal screening package at Nexus Clinic KL includes FSH, LH, oestradiol (E2), progesterone, prolactin, total testosterone, SHBG, TSH and FT4; the comprehensive female screening package adds AMH, DHEA-S, cortisol, fasting insulin, HbA1c, fasting glucose, lipid panel, CBC and liver function tests; both packages include a post-result consultation with a dr who reviews the complete hormonal profile result, provides tailored advice and recommendation, and issues any indicated treatment or referral; female patients receive specific guidance on cycle day timing for their blood test appointment to ensure the most accurate hormonal profile result; this comprehensive health service is available to women from across Malaysia including Penang and Melaka at this clinic in Kuala Lumpur." },
    { q: "Can men get hormone screening at Nexus Clinic KL?", a: "Yes; the male hormonal screening package at Nexus Clinic KL includes total and free testosterone, SHBG, LH, FSH, prolactin, TSH, FT4 and oestradiol as a core male hormonal profile blood test; the comprehensive male screening package adds cortisol, DHEA-S, fasting insulin, HbA1c, fasting glucose, lipid panel, CBC, liver function and haematocrit for a complete hormonal and metabolic health assessment; all male hormone tests are performed as a fasting morning blood test for accurate testosterone measurement; the result is reviewed by a dr at the post-screening consultation with personalised advice and recommendation for any identified hormonal issue; testosterone, thyroid and adrenal hormone assessment together provide the holistic male health screening profile that distinguishes a specialist clinic's service from a standard health check." },
    { q: "How do I know which hormone screening package is right for me?", a: "The right hormone screening package depends on your specific symptoms, age, medical history and health goals; women with irregular periods, PCOS symptoms or fertility concerns are best served by the female hormonal screening package; perimenopausal or menopausal women benefit from the comprehensive female package that includes metabolic health markers alongside the full hormonal profile; men with fatigue, reduced libido or suspected testosterone deficiency are well-served by the core male hormonal screening package; all adults with unexplained chronic disease symptoms or complex hormonal concerns benefit from the comprehensive health screening packages; the most efficient approach is to attend the initial consultation at Nexus Clinic KL where a healthcare professional assesses your specific symptoms and recommends the most appropriate package and blood test schedule for your situation." },
    { q: "How should I prepare for my hormone blood test?", a: "For female patients: schedule the baseline hormonal profile blood test on day 2 to 5 of the menstrual cycle for the most accurate FSH, LH and oestradiol result; if progesterone is being tested for ovulation confirmation, this should be on day 21 of a 28-day cycle (or 7 days after estimated ovulation); all blood tests should be performed as a fasting morning blood test where possible; avoid vigorous exercise and stress on the day before and the morning of testing as these can affect cortisol and prolactin results; for male patients: all testosterone blood tests must be performed as a fasting morning blood test before 10am to capture the diurnal testosterone peak; a practitioner at Nexus Clinic KL provides every patient with a specific preparation guide and schedule for their blood test at the initial consultation." },
    { q: "How long does it take to get hormone blood test results?", a: "Most hormone blood test results at Nexus Clinic KL are available within 2 to 5 working days depending on the specific tests in the screening package; standard hormonal profile tests including FSH, LH, oestradiol, testosterone and TSH are typically available within 2 to 3 working days; specialist tests including AMH, DHEA-S, cortisol and advanced metabolic markers may take 3 to 5 working days; a follow-up appointment is scheduled at the time of the blood test collection to review the complete result with the dr and receive advice and recommendation; patients from Penang, Melaka and other states who cannot return in person for their result review can receive their post-screening consultation by telemedicine." },
    { q: "Do I need a referral to access hormone screening at Nexus Clinic KL?", a: "No referral is needed to access hormone screening at Nexus Clinic KL; any patient who wants to check their hormonal health and book a hormone blood test can contact this clinic directly and schedule an appointment; the initial consultation assesses which health screening package is most appropriate for the patient's specific symptoms and health goals; patients who have already had blood tests at another clinic, hospital or klinik are welcome to bring their previous results for review and comparison; the clinic provides a complete hormone health screening service from initial consultation through blood test collection, result review and treatment planning in a single clinical pathway." },
    { q: "Can Nexus Clinic KL help me if my blood test results from another clinic show hormonal imbalance?", a: "Yes; patients who have already received hormone blood test results from another clinic, klinik or hospital and who want a dr's clinical interpretation, advice and recommendation are welcome at Nexus Clinic KL; the post-result consultation reviews the existing results in the context of the patient's symptoms, medical history and health goals and provides the clinical interpretation and treatment recommendation that may not have been offered at the collection facility; if the existing results are incomplete or if additional tests are needed to complete the hormonal profile, these can be ordered as targeted add-on tests rather than repeating the full panel; this consultation service is a specific and valued offering at this clinic in Kuala Lumpur for patients who have their test results but need medical guidance on what they mean." },
    { q: "Is the hormone screening service at Nexus Clinic KL available to patients from Penang and Melaka?", a: "Yes; Nexus Clinic KL serves patients from across Malaysia including those from hospital Penang, hospital Kuala Lumpur, Melaka and other states who are seeking comprehensive hormone health screening not available at their local medical centre or klinik; for patients who travel from Penang or Melaka, the clinic schedules the initial consultation and blood test collection in a single visit where possible; post-result consultations can be conducted by telemedicine for patients who cannot return in person; the blood test package and price are the same for all patients regardless of location; Nexus Clinic KL is located at Wisma UOA II, Jalan Pinang, 50450 Kuala Lumpur, serving patients from across KL, Petaling Jaya, Bangsar, KLCC, Ampang, Mont Kiara, Penang, Melaka and throughout Malaysia." },

                  Hormone screening is a blood test-based assessment that measures the levels
                  of key hormones circulating in the body to identify hormonal imbalances,
                  deficiencies or excesses that may be driving health issues including fatigue,
                  weight gain, irregular periods, low libido, acne, hair loss, mood disturbance
                  and fertility concerns. A hormone test provides the biological data that a
                  medical practitioner needs to tailor a treatment plan or prevention strategy
                  to the patient's specific hormonal profile. Health screening that includes
                  hormone testing gives patients actionable insight into their hormonal health
                  that general health checks often miss.

                      <strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The most clinically impactful finding from
                      the male hormone screening package is the LH and FSH result alongside
                      testosterone. Every medical practitioner knows that testosterone can be low,
                      but only LH and FSH tell you why it is low — distinguishing primary from
                      secondary hypogonadism and determining appropriate treatment.
