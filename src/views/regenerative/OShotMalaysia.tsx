const OShotLanding = () => {
  const faqs = [
    {
      q: "What is the O-Shot and how does it differ from other vaginal treatments?",
      a: "The O-Shot (Orgasm Shot) is a non-surgical vaginal rejuvenation treatment that uses platelet-rich plasma injection therapy to carefully inject PRP derived from your own blood into specific areas of the vagina including the clitoris, G-spot and anterior vaginal wall; because PRP is derived from your own blood, the minimal risk of side effects is significantly lower than with synthetic or pharmaceutical injectable treatments; the O-Shot is a non-surgical, non-hormonal treatment that relies entirely on the growth factors in your own platelet-rich plasma to stimulate tissue rejuvenation, collagen production and improved blood flow in the vaginal tissue; it differs from local vaginal oestrogen therapy which works through hormonal signalling, and from energy-based vaginal treatments which use thermal or radiofrequency energy to stimulate collagen remodelling; the O-Shot is most effective when used as part of an integrated women's sexual health and wellness programme.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is the O-Shot injection painful?",
      a: "The O-Shot injection is performed under topical numbing cream applied to the vaginal and clitoral area 20 to 30 minutes before the PRP is injected into the vagina; once the numbing cream has taken full effect, most women describe the procedure as producing only mild pressure or minimal discomfort at the injection site; the clitoral area and anterior vaginal wall contain concentrated nerve endings and would be sensitive without adequate numbing, which is why the numbing preparation step is medically necessary and cannot be rushed at a properly operated specialist clinic; you may experience minimal swelling and bruise for up to 3 days after treatment in the treated area, which is an expected and normal response; this is self-limiting and resolves without treatment; sexual activity is typically resumed 3 days after treatment.",
    },
    {
      q: "What conditions can the O-Shot help treat?",
      a: "The O-Shot injections are used for: urinary incontinence (stress urinary incontinence triggered by coughing, sneezing or exercise), where the evidence for improvement is the most consistent of all O-Shot indications; vaginal dryness and painful intercourse, particularly in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women where the O-Shot is most effective when combined with hormone therapy; reduced sexual pleasure and difficulty achieving orgasm, where PRP injected into the vagina may improve sensitivity and the engorgement response of the clitoris and G-spot; vaginal tone improvement as a non-surgical treatment for vagina tightening following childbirth; lichen sclerosus as an emerging indication with promising early evidence; the O-Shot addresses multiple aspects of women's sexual health and overall well-being in a single non-surgical procedure.",
    },
    {
      q: "How many O-Shot sessions are needed and how long do results last?",
      a: "Most specialist clinic protocols recommend 2-3 treatments spaced 2 weeks apart for optimal tissue rejuvenation results; however, some women notice meaningful improvement after a single O-Shot session, particularly for urinary incontinence where the anterior vaginal wall tissue rejuvenation response may be sufficient after one injection; improvement typically begins within a few weeks of the first session and continues to develop from the second to fourth week post-injection as collagen production and new blood vessel formation matures; the O-Shot can last 12 to 18 months before the regenerative effect diminishes and maintenance treatment is recommended; at Nexus Clinic KL, a follow-up consultation at 6 to 8 weeks post-injection assesses the response and determines whether additional O-Shot sessions or programme continuation is appropriate.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is the O-Shot safe for all women?",
      a: "The O-Shot is generally safe for most women because PRP derived from your own blood is used in this natural treatment; making it a safer option compared to many synthetic injectable performance enhancement methods available on the market; the risk of allergic reactions is minimal; however, contraindications to the O-Shot include: active vaginal infection or cervicitis (infection must be treated before any vaginal injection); significant bleeding disorder or current anticoagulant medication that cannot be paused; active cancer or cancer in remission where growth factor injection requires oncologist consultation before proceeding; pregnancy; at Nexus Clinic KL, all contraindications are assessed at the initial consultation before any O-Shot injection is scheduled; women with lichen sclerosus who are interested in the O-Shot are assessed individually as this emerging indication requires specific clinical discussion about current evidence and realistic expectations.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can the O-Shot help with urinary incontinence?",
      a: "Urinary incontinence improvement is the indication with the most published evidence for vaginal PRP injection therapy and is one of the primary reasons many Malaysian women seek the O-Shot; the PRP is carefully injected into specific areas of the vagina adjacent to the urethral sphincter and periurethral tissue to stimulate collagen production and help to heal the muscle tissue in the vagina and periurethral structures that support the sphincter mechanism; improved urethral support from collagen production and blood to repair damaged blood capillaries in the periurethral area reduces involuntary leakage; results for urinary incontinence typically develop within a few weeks and continue to improve over 2 to 3 months as the tissue rejuvenation matures; women with mild to moderate stress urinary incontinence who have not responded to pelvic floor physiotherapy alone may find the O-Shot a useful adjunct; the O-Shot is not a replacement for pelvic floor physiotherapy but complements it by providing growth factor regeneration of the periurethral tissue that exercise alone cannot achieve.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is the G-spot injection component of the O-Shot?",
      a: "The G-spot injection refers to the component of the O-Shot protocol where PRP is carefully injected into the anterior vaginal wall at the location associated with the Grafenberg spot (G-spot), an area of particular sensitivity in the anterior wall of the vagina associated with internal stimulation and orgasm; the G-spot injection is typically included as part of the standard O-Shot injection protocol rather than as a separate procedure; when PRP is injected into the vagina at the anterior wall location, the growth factors stimulate blood flow and neovascularisation in the area, improve the engorgement response of the G-spot tissue during sexual stimulation and may enhance sensitivity and orgasm quality from this area; at Nexus Clinic KL, the O-shot and G-spot injection together as part of the same session are included in the standard O-Shot protocol for women seeking sexual pleasure enhancement; a dedicated enhanced G-spot injection option with additional PRP volume directed to the anterior vaginal wall is also available.",
    },
    {
      q: "How does the O-Shot compare to the P-Shot for couples?",
      a: "The O-Shot for women and the P-Shot (Priapus Shot) for men are the female and male versions of the same PRP injection therapy concept; both use platelet-rich plasma derived from the patient's own blood, injected into the genital tissue to stimulate blood flow, tissue rejuvenation, collagen production and improved sensitivity; a session of P-Shot for the male partner can be scheduled at Nexus Clinic KL on the same day as the O-Shot for the female partner, with both procedures conducted in separate private consultation rooms; the couple's programme approach allows both partners to address their sexual health and overall well-being simultaneously; the sexual health and wellness benefit of both partners receiving regenerative treatment at the same time is that the improvements in sensitivity, erection quality and orgasm occur on a compatible timeline, allowing both partners to notice the changes together within a few weeks of their sessions.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is the O-Shot consultation at Nexus Clinic KL confidential?",
      a: "Yes. All women's sexual health and vaginal rejuvenation consultations at Nexus Clinic KL are fully confidential; the nature of the consultation is not disclosed to reception or administrative staff beyond the scheduling requirement; the O-Shot procedure is performed in a private consultation room by a certified medical LCP-certified doctor; the clinic understands that vaginal and sexual health concerns are among the most personal matters a woman can discuss with a healthcare provider and approaches every consultation with sensitivity, professionalism and without judgement; you are welcome to attend alone and no partner attendance is required; all records are maintained in strict confidence under Malaysian data protection law; Nexus Clinic KL is a specialist clinic and medical centre for women's sexual health serving patients from Bangsar, TTDI, Mont Kiara, KL City, Puchong and across Malaysia.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I make an appointment for the O-Shot at Nexus Clinic KL?",
      a: "To make an appointment for an O-Shot consultation at Nexus Clinic KL, contact us directly by phone or WhatsApp using the contact details on the Nexus Clinic KL website; appointments are available Monday to Saturday; the initial consultation is priced at RM 150 to RM 300 and covers full clinical assessment, treatment discussion and pricing before any O-Shot injection is scheduled; there is no obligation to proceed with treatment at the consultation; contact us for further information on whether the O-Shot, G-spot injection, vaginal oestrogen therapy or a combination approach is most appropriate for your specific sexual health and wellness concerns; Nexus Clinic KL is located at Wisma UOA II, Jalan Pinang, 50450 Kuala Lumpur, a medical centre serving women from across KL, Bangsar, TTDI, Mont Kiara, KL City, Puchong, Petaling Jaya, KLCC, Ampang and throughout Malaysia; contact us today to take the first step toward addressing your sexual health concerns.",
