  // FAQs
  const faqs = [
    { q: "Can PCOS be cured permanently?", a: "There is no cure for pcos. Polycystic ovary syndrome is a chronic hormonal disorder that persists throughout a woman's reproductive life. However, many symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome are treatable and with appropriate pcos treatment, women with PCOS can have regular menstrual cycles, clear skin, manageable hair growth, a healthy metabolic profile and successful pregnancies." },
    { q: "How is PCOS diagnosed in Malaysia?", a: "Pcos diagnosis uses the Rotterdam criteria, which require at least two of: clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism (elevated androgen levels, acne, hirsutism or hair loss), ovulatory dysfunction (irregular or absent menstrual cycle), and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound scan or elevated AMH. The 2023 International PCOS Guideline clarifies that an ultrasound scan is NOT required when both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are present." },
    { q: "Does polycystic ovary syndrome cause infertility?", a: "Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility. However, most women with PCOS can conceive with appropriate pcos treatment. Letrozole is now the first-line ovulation induction agent per the 2023 International PCOS Guideline, preferred over clomiphene for better live birth rates and fewer multiple pregnancies." },
    { q: "What is the best diet for polycystic ovary syndrome?", a: "The 2023 International Evidence-Based PCOS Guideline states there is no single diet superior to others. Dietary approaches that reduce glycaemic load and improve insulin sensitivity have the most direct benefit. For Malaysian women, this means prioritising brown rice over white, reducing sweetened beverages including teh tarik and kopi, and including more vegetables with each meal." },
    { q: "Does losing weight manage PCOS symptoms?", a: "Weight loss in overweight or obese women with PCOS produces significant improvements in insulin resistance, menstrual cycle regularity, androgen levels and fertility outcomes. Studies show 5 to 10% body weight loss restores spontaneous ovulation in 30 to 50% of overweight women with PCOS. However, weight loss does not cure PCOS, and many lean women with PCOS also have significant hormonal imbalance." },
    { q: "Why does PCOS cause acne that does not respond to normal treatment?", a: "PCOS acne is driven by a hormonal imbalance, specifically elevated androgen levels that increase sebum production. Standard acne treatments address the skin-level consequence but do not suppress the androgen imbalance itself. Effective pcos treatment for acne requires systemic anti-androgen treatment as the foundation, with topical therapies as an adjunct." },
    { q: "Is inositol a good pcos treatment?", a: "The 2023 International Evidence-Based PCOS Guideline concluded that metformin has greater efficacy than inositol and that inositol offers limited clinical benefits. Inositol may be considered based on individual preference, but it is not a substitute for prescribed first-line pcos treatment in women with significant polycystic ovary syndrome." },
    { q: "Can PCOS cause hair loss?", a: "Yes. Female pattern hair loss (androgenic alopecia) is a recognised symptom of polycystic ovary syndrome. Elevated androgen levels cause progressive miniaturisation of scalp hair follicles. The most effective pcos treatment combines systemic anti-androgen treatment with topical minoxidil. Response is slow: 6 to 12 months is required to assess improvement." },
    { q: "What is acanthosis nigricans and does it mean I have PCOS?", a: "Acanthosis nigricans is velvety, darkened skin on the back of the neck, armpits and groin crease. It is a direct cutaneous marker of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia. While it can occur without PCOS, its presence in a woman of reproductive age with other symptoms makes PCOS highly probable and warrants formal pcos diagnosis assessment." },
    { q: "Is the PCOS consultation at Nexus Clinic KL free?", a: "The initial PCOS assessment at Nexus Clinic KL is priced at RM 150 to RM 300 and includes a comprehensive menstrual cycle and symptoms history, physical examination for hyperandrogenic signs, blood tests panel requisition, pelvic ultrasound scan referral, and a follow-up appointment to review results and present the personalised pcos treatment plan with full pricing before any prescription is issued." },

              Irregular periods that arrive every two months or not at all. Acne on the jawline and chin that does not respond to the skincare routines that work for everyone else. Excess hair growth on the chin, upper lip or lower abdomen. Scalp hair loss that is thinning at 28. Weight that accumulates around the abdomen despite consistent effort. These are the pcos symptoms in women that many Malaysian women live with daily, and many of the symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome are treatable in every case, even if there is no cure for pcos.

            Polycystic ovary syndrome in Malaysia is under-diagnosed, under-treated and over-supplemented. An estimated 10 to 20% of Malaysian women of reproductive age have PCOS. Nearly half have poor knowledge about the hormonal disorder. Many are spending RM 100 to RM 200 per month on supplements with limited clinical evidence instead of receiving evidence-based assessment and pharmaceutical pcos treatment.
