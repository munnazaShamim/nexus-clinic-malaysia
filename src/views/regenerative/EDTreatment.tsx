                <p className="mb-4" style={{ color: "#AC9990" }}>
                  PDE5 inhibitors work by inhibiting the phosphodiesterase-5 enzyme, preventing cGMP breakdown and prolonging the vasodilatory effect of nitric oxide. They do not cause erections independently but amplify the natural response to sexual stimulation.

                  At Nexus Clinic KL, the specific oral medication prescribed is selected based on food habits, preference for spontaneity, existing cardiovascular medications, and side effect profile.

                  Low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy delivers focused acoustic waves to penile tissues, stimulating angiogenesis through upregulation of VEGF and promoting regeneration of cavernous smooth muscle.

                  Platelet-rich plasma therapy involves drawing blood, centrifuging it to isolate the platelet-rich plasma layer, and injecting it into specific penile locations. Growth factors promote tissue regeneration and improved blood flow.

              ED in Malaysia is undertreated, misdiagnosed as normal ageing and managed without the cause assessment that determines which treatment options will actually work. The 31.6% moderate to severe prevalence confirmed in the Malaysian National Health and Morbidity Survey represents hundreds of thousands of men who deserve better than a generic oral medications prescription without a conversation about causes, cardiovascular risk, and realistic treatment solutions.

              At Nexus Clinic KL, every ED patient receives an assessment that identifies the types and causes before any treatment decision is made. The treatment plan is matched to those causes. Outcomes are discussed honestly, including what oral medications can and cannot do, who benefits from shockwave therapy and who does not, the role of a sex therapist for psychogenic ED, and what lifestyle changes produce real improvement.
