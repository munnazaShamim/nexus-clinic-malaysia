      q: "What is hypothyroidism and how common is it in Malaysia?",
      a: "Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone for the body's needs. Hypothyroidism is a common endocrine disorder affecting approximately 1 in 50 people in Malaysia, with women and those over 60 at significantly higher risk. It is the most prevalent thyroid disorder in Malaysia. Hypothyroidism is a common condition that is significantly undiagnosed because its symptoms of hypothyroidism develop gradually and overlap with many other common conditions including depression, anaemia and perimenopause. A simple TSH blood test is all that is required to identify whether hypothyroidism is present."
    },
    {
      q: "What are the most common hypothyroidism symptoms in Malaysian women?",
      a: "The most common hypothyroidism symptoms in Malaysian women include persistent fatigue that is not relieved by sleep, unexplained weight gain, cold intolerance (feeling cold in air-conditioned offices when colleagues are comfortable), low mood and depression, hair loss or thinning, dry skin, brain fog and poor concentration, and irregular or heavy menstrual periods. These symptoms of hypothyroidism are the same in Malaysian women as globally but are frequently attributed to work stress, iron deficiency, ageing or perimenopause before thyroid function is investigated. The combination of fatigue plus cold intolerance plus weight gain in a Malaysian woman under 60 is a particularly strong clinical indicator that warrants a TSH blood test as the first investigation."
    },
    {
      q: "How is hypothyroidism diagnosed?",
      a: "The diagnosis of hypothyroidism begins with a clinical history of hypothyroidism symptoms and a physical examination of the thyroid gland and for clinical signs of underactive thyroid including goitre, bradycardia, dry skin and delayed tendon reflexes. The primary blood test for hypothyroidism diagnosis is the TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) test: a high TSH level indicates the pituitary gland is working harder to stimulate an underperforming thyroid gland. A low FT4 combined with high TSH confirms overt hypothyroidism. A normal FT4 with high TSH defines subclinical hypothyroidism. Anti-TPO antibody testing identifies whether Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the autoimmune cause. At Nexus Clinic KL, the hypothyroidism diagnosis process follows the physical examination with a structured blood test panel and the results are interpreted in the full clinical context rather than by blood test numbers alone."
    },
    {
      q: "What is the difference between overt and subclinical hypothyroidism?",
      a: "Overt hypothyroidism is defined by a high TSH blood test result combined with a low FT4; this combination confirms that the thyroid gland is not producing enough thyroid hormone to meet the body's needs and that clinical hypothyroidism symptoms are present or will develop; overt hypothyroidism requires prompt levothyroxine treatment in virtually all patients. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined by a high TSH blood test result with a normal FT4; the thyroid gland is producing sufficient thyroid hormone for now but the pituitary is working harder than normal to maintain it; whether to treat subclinical hypothyroidism with levothyroxine depends on the TSH level, the patient's age, the presence of hypothyroidism symptoms, anti-TPO antibody status and pregnancy."
    },
    {
      q: "What is Hashimoto's thyroiditis and does it cause hypothyroidism?",
      a: "Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system produces antibodies (anti-TPO antibodies) that progressively destroy thyroid gland tissue; it is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient countries including Malaysia. Hypothyroidism from Hashimoto's thyroiditis develops gradually as the autoimmune attack reduces the number of functioning thyroid cells; TSH rises progressively and eventually FT4 falls, at which point overt hypothyroidism is confirmed on blood test and levothyroxine treatment is initiated. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is confirmed by a positive anti-TPO antibody result on blood test; the presence of anti-TPO antibodies identifies patients with subclinical hypothyroidism who are at higher risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism and who typically benefit from earlier levothyroxine treatment."
    },
    {
      q: "Is levothyroxine the only treatment for hypothyroidism?",
      a: "Levothyroxine (synthetic thyroxine) is the evidence-based first-line hypothyroidism treatment endorsed by all major clinical practice guidelines including the American Thyroid Association and AACE. It is the gold standard because it provides a pure, consistent dose of thyroxine that can be precisely titrated using TSH blood test results. Desiccated thyroid extract, which contains both T3 and T4 from animal thyroid glands, is an alternative that some patients prefer, but it is not recommended as first-line treatment in current clinical practice guidelines because of the difficulty in achieving consistent dosing and the potential for excess T3 exposure. For most Malaysian patients, levothyroxine monotherapy achieves excellent symptom control and normalises TSH blood test results when taken correctly and at the appropriate dosage."
    },
    {
      q: "What complications can untreated hypothyroidism cause?",
      a: "The complications of hypothyroidism from prolonged untreated thyroid hormone deficiency include dyslipidaemia (elevated LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol), hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure and pericardial effusion from the cardiovascular effects of thyroid hormone deficiency; peripheral neuropathy, cognitive decline and depression from the neurological effects; myxedema, the characteristic non-pitting facial and periorbital swelling from mucopolysaccharide accumulation in the dermis that represents advanced untreated hypothyroidism; and in the most severe cases, myxedema coma, which is a life-threatening endocrine emergency with high mortality. In pregnancy, undiagnosed or inadequately treated hypothyroidism significantly increases the risk of miscarriage, premature birth, preeclampsia and impaired foetal brain development. In infants, undiagnosed congenital hypothyroidism causes irreversible intellectual disability. Early diagnosis through blood test screening prevents all of these complications."
    },
    {
      q: "Does hypothyroidism require lifelong treatment?",
      a: "Whether hypothyroidism treatment is lifelong depends on the underlying cause. Hashimoto's thyroiditis-related hypothyroidism is typically lifelong because the autoimmune disease progressively destroys thyroid gland tissue and the thyroid gland does not regenerate; once levothyroxine treatment is initiated for Hashimoto's hypothyroidism, it is almost always required permanently. Post-thyroid surgery hypothyroidism (particularly after total thyroidectomy) requires lifelong levothyroxine as the thyroid gland has been removed. Congenital hypothyroidism requires lifelong treatment. Some causes of hypothyroidism, such as postpartum thyroiditis, may be transient, with thyroid function recovering spontaneously within 12 to 18 months in a significant proportion of affected women; these patients are monitored with serial TSH blood tests before a decision to continue or discontinue levothyroxine is made."
    },
    {
      q: "Can hypothyroidism affect fertility and pregnancy?",
      a: "Yes. Hypothyroidism is one of the most important and readily treatable causes of subfertility in Malaysian women. Thyroid hormone deficiency disrupts the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, causing irregular menstrual cycles, anovulation and reduced fertility. Women with hypothyroidism who are trying to conceive should have their TSH blood test levels maintained below 2.5 mIU/L for optimal fertility outcomes; this is the same TSH target recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy. Undiagnosed or inadequately treated hypothyroidism in pregnancy significantly increases the risk of miscarriage, premature birth, preeclampsia and impaired foetal neurological development. Women with known hypothyroidism should contact Nexus Clinic KL as soon as pregnancy is confirmed for urgent TSH blood test review and levothyroxine dosage adjustment."
    },
    {
      q: "Is the hypothyroidism consultation at Nexus Clinic KL free?",
      a: "The initial hypothyroidism assessment at Nexus Clinic KL is priced at RM 150 to RM 300 and includes a comprehensive hypothyroidism symptoms history, hypothyroidism risk factors review, physical examination of the thyroid gland and clinical signs of underactive thyroid, blood test requisition for the TSH, FT4 and anti-TPO antibody panel, and a follow-up appointment to review blood test results and present the personalised treatment plan with full pricing before any prescription is issued. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, the cause identified through blood test and physical examination, and the appropriate treatment approach are all discussed in detail before levothyroxine is prescribed. Nexus Clinic KL is located at Wisma UOA II, Jalan Pinang, 50450 Kuala Lumpur, serving patients from across KL, Petaling Jaya, Bangsar, KLCC, Ampang, Mont Kiara and throughout Malaysia."

                The congenital hypothyroidism row in this table deserves particular emphasis for Malaysian parents. Congenital hypothyroidism is present at birth and requires early diagnosis and treatment within the first weeks of life to prevent irreversible intellectual disability. Malaysia's national neonatal screening programme includes TSH screening from a heel-prick blood test at day 3 to 5 of life; a positive congenital hypothyroidism screen must be followed up urgently with a confirmatory thyroid function blood test and levothyroxine initiated as soon as congenital hypothyroidism is confirmed.

              Hypothyroidism is a common endocrine condition in Malaysia that is too often left undiagnosed for years while its symptoms are managed as separate, unrelated problems. Fatigue, weight gain, dyslipidaemia, depression, subfertility and hair loss are all potential manifestations of a single, easily diagnosed, highly treatable thyroid disorder. A single TSH blood test is the most important first step.
